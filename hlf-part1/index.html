<p>In this lab, you will work with the Marbles demo application, which is
considered by many to be a de facto "hello world" application for
getting started with Hyperledger Fabric. Hyperledger Fabric is one of
several projects within the open-source Hyperledger collaborative effort
hosted by the Linux Foundation. Hyperledger Fabric provides the
distributed ledger, a.k.a. blockchain, technology that is the core of
IBM Blockchain solutions and services.</p>
<p>You will use Docker Compose to bring up a Hyperledger Fabric network in
which two organizations will participate. There will be one orderer
service for the entire network, and each organization will use its own
certificate authority service and have two peer nodes. Each peer node
will use CouchDB for its ledger store. Each peer node's CouchDB will
run in a separate Docker container. That makes eleven Docker containers,
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 orderer service Docker container</li>
<li>2 certificate authority (CA) Docker containers (one for each
    organization)</li>
<li>4 peer node Docker containers (each of the two organizations has two
    peers)</li>
<li>4 CouchDB Docker containers (each peer node has its own separate
    CouchDB ledger store)</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also bring up a twelfth Docker container that we will call the
<em>cli</em> container. You will use it as a convenience to enter Hyperledger
Fabric commands targeted to specific peers. You will see how this is
done later in the lab.</p>
<p>The network you bring up will use Transport Layer Security (TLS) which
provides secure, encrypted communications between the peer nodes and the
orderer, just as most production implementations will require.</p>
<p>You will <strong>install</strong> the Marbles chaincode on the peer nodes,
<strong>instantiate</strong> the chaincode, and <strong>invoke</strong> functions of the
chaincode. I will explain later in the lab the difference between the
install and instantiate actions and what each one does.</p>
<h1 id="section-2-description-of-the-subsequent-sections-in-part-1">Section 2 - Description of the subsequent sections in Part 1</h1>
<p>This section provides a brief description of the subsequent sections in Part 1 of the
lab, where you will get hands-on experience with the Hyperledger Fabric
command line interface (CLI). In most production implementations you
would perform many of these functions through other means, such as
programmatically through an Application Programming Interface (API)
provided by a Hyperledger Fabric Software Development Kit (SDK), which
the project provides for the Node.js, Java, Golang and Python
programming languages, or perhaps through a user interface such as the
one provided by the IBM Blockchain Platform. But using the CLI, as you
will in this lab, is a great way to learn about how Hyperledger Fabric
works.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will extract the artifacts necessary to run the lab in
    Section 3. All the artifacts necessary for the lab are provided in a
    compressed tarball- in essence, a zip file.</li>
<li>You will use Docker Compose in Section 4 to bring up the twelve
    Docker containers that comprise the Hyperledger Fabric network. You
    will see that all twelve Docker containers that I mentioned in
    Section 1 are brought up with a single <em>docker-compose</em> command, and
    I will explain some of the more interesting bits of what is going on
    under the covers.</li>
<li>You will create a channel in the Hyperledger Fabric network in
    Section 5. In Hyperledger Fabric, each channel is essentially its
    own blockchain.</li>
<li>You will instruct each peer node to join the channel in Section 6.
    We will join all four Peer nodes to the channel. Peer nodes can be
    members of more than one channel, but for this lab you are only
    creating one channel.</li>
<li>You will define an "anchor" peer for each organization in the
    channel in Section 7. An anchor peer for an organization is a peer
    that is known by all the other organizations in a channel. Not all
    peers for an organization need to be known by outside organizations.
    Peers not defined as anchor peers are visible only within their own
    organization.</li>
<li>You will install the chaincode on the peer nodes in Section 8.
    Installing chaincode simply puts the chaincode executable on the
    file system of the peer. It is a necessary step before you execute
    that chaincode on the peer, but the next step is also required.</li>
<li>You will instantiate the chaincode on the channel in Section 9. This
    step is a prerequisite to being able to run chaincode on a channel.
    It only needs to be performed on one peer that is a member of the
    channel. This causes a transaction to be recorded on the channel's
    blockchain to indicate that the chaincode can be run on the channel.</li>
<li>You will invoke functions on the chaincode that will create, read,
    update and delete (CRUD) data stored on the blockchain in
    Section 10. Blocks of transactions in a blockchain are always added
    (i.e., created), and they can be read, but they are never, in normal
    operations, updated or deleted. However, although the blocks in a
    chain are not updated or deleted, the transactions themselves
    operate on Key/Value pairs that can have all CRUD operations
    performed on them. This collection of Key/Value pairs is often
    referred to as state data.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="section-3-extract-the-artifacts-necessary-to-run-the-lab">Section 3 - Extract the artifacts necessary to run the lab</h1>
<p>Log in to your assigned Linux on Z Ubuntu instance with the instructions
provided to you by your class instructor. If you are using Linux or
MacOS you will likely be using <em>ssh</em> to log in via a <em>Terminal</em> window.
If you are using Windows, you will most likely be using a <em>PuTTY</em>
terminal session. If you are trying this lab at home, I am assuming you
can figure out how to log in.</p>
<p>All of the following instructions in the lab assume that you have
successfully logged in to the Linux on Z Ubuntu instance assigned to
your team. As you proceed through the lab, you will have to be logged in
to more than one terminal session. When that becomes necessary, simply
follow the same procedure used to log in to your first terminal session.</p>
<p>Let's get started!</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.1:</strong> Navigate to the home directory by entering <em>cd ~</em> (the
"tilde" character, i.e., '<em>~</em>', represents the user's home directory in
Linux). This directory is also usually set in the $HOME environment
variable, so <em>cd $HOME</em> will also usually get you to your home
directory:</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ cd ~
bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note:</em> You may already be in your home directory prior to entering <em>cd
~</em>, in which case you'll just stay there- not a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.2:</strong> Retrieve the zmarbles compressed tarball prepared for this
lab with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silliman/2019FastStart/master/zmarbles.tar.gz
--2019-01-21 07:51:53--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silliman/2019FastStart/master/zmarbles.tar.gz

2019-01-21 07:51:53 (82.3 MB/s) - 'zmarbles.tar.gz' saved [12299004/12299004]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 3.3:</strong> The <em>zmarbles</em> directory should not yet exist. Prove it
with this <em>ls</em> command:</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ ls zmarbles     
ls: cannot access 'zmarbles': No such file or directory
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 3.4:</strong> Extract the <em>zmarbles.tar.gz</em> file which will create the
missing directory (and lots of subdirectories). If you want to see the
name of all of the files and directories that are extracted, add the
"<em>v</em>" switch into the options in the command below. That is, use <em>-xzvf</em>
instead of <em>-xzf</em>. So, enter the <em>tar</em> command below as shown, feeling
free to substitute <em>-xzvf</em> for <em>-xzf</em> in the command (the "<em>v</em>" is for
"<em>verbose</em>") :</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ tar -xzf zmarbles.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 3.5:</strong> List the <em>zmarbles</em> directory with this command:</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ ls -l zmarbles

</code></pre>
<p>An explanation of the purpose of each of these files and directories is
given here:</p>
<p>The <em>base</em> directory contains Docker Compose files that are included in
the <em>docker-compose-template.yaml</em> file with the <em>extends</em> directive.</p>
<p>The <em>bin</em> directory contains two executable programs, <em>cryptogen</em> and
<em>configtxgen</em>, that will be run later when you execute the
<em>generateArtifacts.sh</em> script.</p>
<p>The <em>channel-artifacts</em> directory is empty, but it must exist when the
<em>generateArtifacts.sh</em> script, which you will run later, invokes the
<em>configtxgen</em> utility. The <em>configtxgen</em> utility generates input to
channel configuration transaction inputs, and it is expecting the
<em>channel-artifacts</em> directory to exist.</p>
<p>The <em>configtx.yaml</em> file is input to the <em>configtxgen</em> utility</p>
<p>The <em>cryto-config.yaml</em> file is input to the <em>cryptogen</em> utiity, which
is called by the <em>generateArtifacts.sh</em> script to create cryptographic
material (in the form of X.509 certificates and public and private key
pairs) used to identify peers, orderers, and administrative and regular
users of a Hyperledger Fabric network.</p>
<p>The <em>docker-compose-template.yaml</em> file is used as a template file that
the <em>generateArtifacts.sh</em> script will use to create the main Docker
Compose template file, <em>docker-compose.yaml</em>, which contains definitions
for all of the Docker containers that you will need.</p>
<p>The <em>examples</em> directory contains the actual Marbles chaincode within
its subdirectory structure.</p>
<p>The <em>generateArtifacts.sh</em> script is used to generate channel
configuration transaction input and to generate cryptographic material
and it also creates <em>docker-compose.yaml</em>, using
<em>docker-compose-template.yaml</em> as input.</p>
<p>The <em>hostScripts</em> directory is not used in this lab.</p>
<p>The <em>marblesUI</em> directory is used in the next lab, in which you will be
working with the brwoser-based user interface (UI) for Marbles.</p>
<p>The <em>scripts</em> directory contains a script named <em>setpeer</em> that you will
be using throughout this lab from within the <em>cli</em> Docker container.
<em>setpeer</em> will be explained in <em>Section 5</em>.   </p>
<h1 id="section-4-bring-up-the-twelve-docker-containers-that-comprise-the-hyperledger-fabric-network">Section 4 - Bring up the twelve Docker containers that comprise the Hyperledger Fabric network</h1>
<p><strong>Step 4.1:</strong> Change to the <em>zmarbles</em> directory with the <em>cd</em> command:</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ cd zmarbles/ 
bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 4.2:</strong> You are going to run a script named <em>generateArtifacts.sh</em>
that will create some configuration information that is necessary to get
your Hyperledger Fabric network set up. There is one optional parameter
you may pass to the script, and that is the name of the channel you will
be creating. If you do not specify this parameter, the channel name
defaults to <em>mychannel</em>. You may choose to specify your own channel
name. E.g., if you wished to name your channel <em>tim</em>, then you would
enter <em>./generateArtifacts.sh tim</em> instead of just
<em>./generateArtifacts.sh</em> when directed below to enter the command.</p>
<p><strong>Note: If you pick your own channel name, it must start with a
lowercase character, and only contain lowercase characters, numbers, or
the dash ('-') character, or the period ('.').</strong></p>
<p>So, enter the command below, optionally specifying a custom channel name
(not shown here) as the lone argument to the <em>generateArtifacts.sh</em>
script:</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ source ./generateArtifacts.sh    # specify a custom channel name or accept the default value of 'mychannel'

<p>By the way, if you enter a command and end it with #, everything after
the # is considered a comment and is ignored by the shell. So, if you
see me place comments after any commands you do not have to enter them
but if you do, it will not hurt anything.</p>
<p>This script calls two Hyperledger Fabric utilites- <em>cryptogen</em>, which
creates security material (certificates and keys) and <em>configtxgen</em>
(Configuration Transaction Generator), which is called four times, to
create four things:</p>
<ol>
<li>An <strong>orderer genesis block</strong> -- this will be the first block on the
    orderer's system channel. The location of this block is specified to
    the Orderer when it is started up via the
    ORDERER_GENERAL_GENESISFILE environment variable.</li>
<li>A <strong>channel transaction</strong> -- later in the lab, this is sent to the
    orderer and will cause a new channel to be created when you run the
    <strong>peer channel create</strong> command.</li>
<li>An <strong>anchor peer update</strong> for Org0MSP. An anchor peer is a peer that
    is set up so that peers from other organizations may communicate
    with it. The concept of anchor peers allows an organization to
    create multiple peers, perhaps to provide extra capacity or
    throughput or resilience (or all the above) but not have to
    advertise this to outside organizations.</li>
<li>An anchor peer update for Org1MSP. You will perform the anchor peer
    updates for both Org0MSP and Org1MSP later in the lab via <strong>peer
    channel create</strong> commands.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 4.3:</strong> Issue the following command which will show you all files
that were created by the <em>configtxgen</em> utility when it was called from
inside <em>generateArtifacts.sh</em>:</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ ls -ltr channel-artifacts
total 28
-rw-r--r-- 1 bcuser bcuser 12787 Oct 22 14:08 genesis.block
-rw-r--r-- 1 bcuser bcuser   346 Oct 22 14:08 channel.tx
-rw-r--r-- 1 bcuser bcuser   285 Oct 22 14:08 Org0MSPanchors.tx
-rw-r--r-- 1 bcuser bcuser   282 Oct 22 14:08 Org1MSPanchors.tx
</code></pre>
<p><em>genesis.block</em> will be passed to the <em>orderer</em> at startup, and will be
used to configure the orderer's <em>system channel</em>. This file contains
the x.509 signing certificates for every organization defined within the
consortia that were specified within the <em>configtx.yaml</em> file when
<em>configtxgen</em> was run. The <em>system channel</em> contains other values such
as parameters defining when a block of transactions is cut- e.g., based
on time, number of transactions, or block size- and these values serve
as a template, that is, as defaults, for any additional channels that
might be created, if a new channel creation request does not provide its
own custom values.</p>
<p><em>channel.tx</em> is the input for a configuration transaction that will
create a channel. You will use this as input to a <em>peer channel create</em>
request in <em>Section 5</em>.</p>
<p><em>Org0MSPanchors.tx</em> and <em>Org1MSPanchors.tx</em> are inputs for configuration
transactions that will define an anchor peer for <em>Org0</em> and <em>Org1</em>
respectively. You will use these inputs in <em>Section 7</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.4:</strong> Issue the following command which will show you all files
that were created by the <em>cryptogen</em> utility when it was called from
inside <em>generateArtifacts.sh</em>. This command will show one screen at a
time and pause- press the <em>Enter</em> key to scroll to the end, that is,
until you get your command prompt back:</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ ls -ltrR crypto-config | more
  .
  .  (output not shown here)
  .
</code></pre>
<p>Actually, these files were created <em>before</em> the files listed in the
prior step, <em>Step 4.3</em>, were created, because, among the many
cryptographic artifacts created are the x.509 signing certificates for
the organizations, which are baked into the <em>genesis.block</em> discussed in
the prior step.</p>
<p>You can see that there is a dizzying set of directories and files,
containing things like CA root certificates, signing certificates, TLS
certificates, corresponding private keys, and public keys, for
certificate authorities, organizations, administrative and general
users. A thorough discussion of them is beyond the scope of this lab.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This utiltity created crypto material for both organizations,
including private keys that each organization would keep secret and
never share with the other organizations. You have created this for both
organizations on a single server for purposes of this lab, but in a
production implementation each organization would create their own
material separately so that they could indeed keep their private keys to
themselves. Their public certificates, which are meant to be shared, are
baked into the channel definitions for channels in which they
participate. This allows peer nodes from all organizations in a channel
to verify digital signatures of transaction requests and transaction
endorsements from other organizations that are members of the channel.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.5:</strong> You are going to look inside the Docker Compose
configuration file a little bit. Enter the following command:</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ vi -R docker-compose.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>You can enter <code>Ctrl-f</code> to scroll forward in the file and <code>Ctrl-b</code> to
scroll back in the file. The <em>-R</em> flag opens the file in read-only mode,
so if you accidentally change something in the file, it's okay. It will
not be saved.</p>
<p>The statements within <em>docker-compose.yaml</em> are in a markup language
called <em>YAML</em>, which stands for <em>Y</em>et <em>A</em>nother <em>M</em>arkup <em>L</em>anguage.
(Who says nerds do not have a sense of humor). We will go over some
highlights here.</p>
<p>There are twelve "services", or Docker containers, defined within this
file. They all start in column 3 and have several statements to describe
them. For example, the first service defined is <strong>ca0</strong>, and there are
<em>image</em>, <em>environment</em>, <em>ports</em>, <em>command</em>, <em>volumes</em>, and
<em>container_name</em> statements that describe it. If you scroll down in the
file with <code>Ctrl-f</code> you will see all the services. Not every service has
the same statements describing it.</p>
<p>The twelve services are:</p>
<p><strong>ca0</strong> -- The certificate authority service for "Organization 0"
(unitedmarbles.com)</p>
<p><strong>ca1</strong> -- The certificate authority service for "Organization 1"
(marblesinc.com)</p>
<p><strong>orderer.blockchain.com</strong> -- The single ordering service that both
organizations will use</p>
<p><strong>peer0.unitedmarbles.com</strong> -- The first peer node for "Organization 0"</p>
<p><strong>peer1.unitedmarbles.com</strong> -- The second peer node for "Organization 0"</p>
<p><strong>peer0.marblesinc.com</strong> -- The first peer node for "Organization 1"</p>
<p><strong>peer1.marblesinc.com</strong> -- The second peer node for "Organization 1"</p>
<p><strong>couchdb0</strong> -- The CouchDB server for peer0.unitedmarbles.com</p>
<p><strong>couchdb1</strong> -- The CouchDB server for peer1.unitedmarbles.com</p>
<p><strong>couchdb2</strong> -- The CouchDB server for peer0.marblesinc.com</p>
<p><strong>couchdb3</strong> -- The CouchDB server for peer1.marblesinc.com</p>
<p><strong>cli</strong> -- The Docker container from which you will enter Hyperledger
Fabric command line interface (CLI) commands targeted towards a peer
node.</p>
<p>I will describe how several statements work within the file, but time
does not permit me to address every single line in the file!</p>
<p><em>image</em> statements define which Docker image file the Docker container
will be created from. Basically, the Docker image file is a static file
that, once created, is read-only. A Docker container is based on a
Docker image, and any changes to the file system within a Docker
container are stored within the container. So, multiple Docker
containers can be based on the same Docker image, and each Docker
container keeps track of its own changes. For example, the containers
built for the <strong>ca0</strong> and <strong>ca1</strong> service will both be based on the
<em>hyperledger/fabric-ca:1.4.0</em> Docker image because they both have this
statement in their definition:</p>
<pre><code>image: hyperledger/fabric-ca:1.4.0
</code></pre>
<p><em>environment</em> statements define environment variables that are available
to the Docker container. The Hyperledger Fabric processes make ample use
of environment variables. In general, you will see that the certificate
authority environment variables start with <em>FABRIC_CA</em>, the orderer's
environment variables start with <em>ORDERER_GENERAL</em>, and the peer node's
environment variables start with <em>CORE</em>. These variables control
behavior of the Hyperledger Fabric code, and in many cases, will
override values that are specified in configuration files. Notice that
all the peers and the orderer have an environment variable to specify
that TLS is enabled- <em>CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true</em> for the peers and
<em>ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_ENABLED=true</em> for the orderer. You will notice
there are other TLS-related variables to specify private keys,
certificates and root certificates.</p>
<p><em>ports</em> statements map ports on our Linux on IBM Z host to ports within
the Docker container. The syntax is <em>&lt;host port&gt;:&lt;Docker container port&gt;</em>. 
For example, the service for <strong>ca1</strong> has this port statement:</p>
<pre><code>ports:
  - "8054:7054"
</code></pre>
<p>This says that port 7054 in the Docker container for the <strong>ca1</strong> node
will be mapped to port 8054 on your Linux on IBM Z host. This is how you
can run two CA nodes in two Docker containers and four peer nodes in
four Docker containers and keep things straight- within each CA node
they are both using port 7054, and within each peer node Docker
container, they are all using port 7051 for the same thing, but if you
want to get to one of the peers from your host or even the outside
world, you would target the appropriate host-mapped port. <strong>Note:</strong> To
see the port mappings for the peers you have to look in
<em>base/docker-compose.yaml</em>. See if you can figure out why.</p>
<p><em>container_name</em> statements are used to create hostnames that the
Docker containers spun up by the docker-compose command use to
communicate with each other. A separate, private network will be created
by Docker where the 12 Docker containers can communicate with each other
via the names specified by <em>container_name</em>. So, they do not need to
worry about the port mappings from the <em>ports</em> statements- those are
used for trying to get to the Docker containers from outside the private
network created by Docker.</p>
<p><em>volumes</em> statements are used to map file systems on the host to file
systems within the Docker container. Just like with ports, the file
system on the host system is on the left and the file system name mapped
within the Docker container is on the right. For example, look at this
statement from the <strong>ca0</strong> service:</p>
<pre><code>volumes:
  - ./crypto-config/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/ca/:/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config
</code></pre>
<p>The security-related files that were created from the previous step
where you ran <em>generateArtifacts.sh</em> were all within the <em>crypto-config</em>
directory on your Linux on IBM Z host. The prior <em>volumes</em> statement is
how this stuff is made accessible to the <strong>ca1</strong> service that will run
within the Docker container. Similar magic is done for the other
services as well, except for the CouchDB services.</p>
<p><em>extends</em> statements are used by the peer nodes. What this does is merge
in other statements from another file. For example, you may notice that
the peer nodes do not contain an images statement. How does Docker know
what Docker image file to base the container on? That is defined in the
file, <em>base/peer-base.yaml</em>, specified in the <em>extends</em> section of
<em>base/docker-compose.yaml</em>, which is specified in the <em>extends</em> section
of <em>docker-compose.yaml</em> for the peer nodes.</p>
<p><em>command</em> statements define what command is run when the Docker
container is started. This is how the actual Hyperledger Fabric
processes get started. You can define default commands when you create
the Docker image. This is why you do not see <em>command</em> statements for
the <strong>cli</strong> service or for the CouchDB services. For the peer nodes, the
command statement is specified in the <em>base/peer-base.yaml</em> file.</p>
<p><em>working_dir</em> statements define what directory the Docker container
will be in when its startup commands are run. Again, defaults for this
can be defined when the Docker image is created.</p>
<p>When you are done reviewing the <em>docker-compose.yaml</em> file, exit the
<em>vi</em> session by typing <code>:q!</code> (that's "colon", "q", "exclamation point")
which will exit the file and discard any changes you may have
accidentally made while browsing through the file. If <code>:q!</code> doesn't work
right away, you may have to hit the escape key first before trying it.
If that still doesn't work, ask an instructor for help- <em>vi</em> can be
tricky if you are not used to it.</p>
<p>If you would like to see what is in the <em>base/docker-compose-base.yaml</em>
and <em>base/peer-base.yaml</em> files I mentioned, take a quick peek with
<code>vi -R base/docker-compose-base.yaml</code> and <code>vi -R base/peer-base.yaml</code>
and exit with the <code>:q!</code> key sequence when you have had enough.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.6:</strong> Start the Hyperledger Fabric network by entering the
command shown below:</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ docker-compose up --detach
Creating network "zmarbles_default" with the default driver

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Depending upon the circumstances under which you run this lab,
the Hyperledger Fabric Docker images required may be pulled down from
the public Docker image repository, in which case you will observe
messages, not shown above, that show the progress of the necessary
downloads.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.7:</strong> Verify that all twelve services are <em>Up</em> and none of them
say <em>Exited</em>. The <em>Exited</em> status means something went wrong, and you
should check with an instructor for help if you see any of them in
<em>Exited</em> status.</p>
<p>If, however, all twelve of your Docker containers are in <em>Up</em> status, as
in the output below, you are ready to proceed to the next section:</p>

<h1 id="section-5-create-a-channel-in-the-hyperledger-fabric-network">Section 5 - Create a channel in the Hyperledger Fabric network</h1>
<p>In a Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.0 network, multiple channels can be created.
Each channel can have its own policies for things such as requirements
for endorsement and what organizations may join the channel. This allows
for a subset of network participants to participate in their own
channel.</p>
<p>Imagine a scenario where OrgA, OrgB and OrgC are three organizations
participating in the network. You could set up a channel in which all
three organizations participate. You could also set up a channel where
only OrgA and OrgB participate. In this case, the peers in OrgC would
not see the transactions occurring in that channel. OrgA could
participate in another channel with only OrgC, in which case OrgB does
not have visibility. And so on.</p>
<p>You could create channels with the same participants, but have different
policies. For example, perhaps one channel with OrgA, OrgB, and OrgC
could require all three organizations to endorse a transaction proposal,
but another channel with OrgA, OrgB and OrgC could require just two, or
even just one, of the three organizations to endorse a transaction
proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A use case where only one organization would need to endorse a
transaction proposal would be unusual, as the whole point of blockchain
is for multiple organizations to agree on what is valid transaction, and
allowing just one organization to consider a transaction valid sort of
goes against the grain of that type of thinking, but I never say never
(oops! I just said it twice) but it is technically possible. Most trust
models would probably call for a majority, a super-majority (e.g.
two-thirds), or even unanimous consent (100%) of the organizations in
the channel to endorse a transaction proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A policy of requiring unanimous consent implies that each
member organization should build an available and resilient
infrastructure since if even one organization's peers are unavailable,
then additions to the blockchain for that channel would grind to a halt.
Then again, who runs in production without an available and resilient
infrastructure anyway?</p>
<p>The decision on how many channels to create and what policies they have
will usually be driven by the requirements of the particular business
problem being solved.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.1:</strong> Access the <em>cli</em> Docker container:</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ docker exec --interactive --tty cli bash
root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer#ic/peer#
</code></pre>
<p>Observe that your command prompt changes when you enter the Docker
container's shell.</p>
<p>The <em>docker exec</em> command runs a command against an existing Docker
container. The <em>--interactive</em> and <em>--tty</em> arguments basically work
together to say, "we want an interactive terminal session with this
Docker container". <em>cli</em> is the name of the Docker container (this came
from the <em>container_name</em> statement in the <em>docker-compose.yaml</em> file
for the <em>cli</em> service). <em>bash</em> is the name of the command you want to
enter. In other words, you are entering a Bash shell within the <em>cli</em>
Docker container. For most of the rest of the lab, you will be entering
commands within this Bash shell.</p>
<p>Instead of working as user <em>bcuser</em> on the ubuntu16045 server in the
<em>~/zmarbles</em> directory, you are now inside the Docker container with ID
<em>acd1f96d8807</em> (your ID will differ), working in the
<em>/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer</em> directory. It is no
coincidence that that directory is the value of the <em>working_dir</em>
statement for the <em>cli</em> service in your <em>docker-compose.yaml</em> file.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.2:</strong> Read on to learn about a convenience script to point to a
particular peer from the <em>cli</em> Docker container. Within the <em>cli</em>
container, a convenience script named <em>setpeer</em> is provided in the
<em>scripts</em> subdirectory of your current working directory. This script
will set the environment variables to the values necessary to point to a
particular peer. The script takes two arguments. The first argument is
either 0 or 1 for Organization 0 or Organization 1 respectively, and the
second argument is for either Peer 0 or Peer 1 of the organization
selected by the first argument. Therefore, throughout the remainder of
this lab, before sending commands to a peer, you will enter one of the
following four valid combinations from within the <em>cli</em> Docker
container, depending on which peer you want to run the command on:</p>
<p><em>source scripts/setpeer 0 0</em> # to target Org 0, peer 0
(peer0.unitedmarbles.com)</p>
<p><em>source scripts/setpeer 0 1</em> # to target Org 0, peer 1 (peer1.united
marbles.com)</p>
<p><em>source scripts/setpeer 1 0</em> # to target Org 1, peer 0
(peer0.marblesinc.com)</p>
<p><em>source scripts/setpeer 1 1</em> # to target Org 1, peer 1
(peer1.marblesinc.com)</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.3:</strong> Choose your favorite peer and use one of the four <em>source
scripts/setpeer</em> commands listed in the prior step. Although you are
going to join all four peers to our channel, you only need to issue the
channel creation command once. You can issue it from any of the four
peers, so pick your favorite peer and issue the source command. In this
screen snippet, I have chosen Org 1, peer 1. Issue the command below,
leaving the arguments '1 1' as is, or change it to one of the other
valid combinations as described in the previous step:</p>
<pre><code>root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# source scripts/setpeer 1 1

root@fbe81505b8a2:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer#
</code></pre>
<p>The last environment variable listed, <em>CORE_PEER_ADDRESS</em>, determines
to which peer your commands will be routed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.4:</strong> The Hyperledger Fabric network is configured to require
TLS, so when you enter your peer commands, you need to add a flag that
indicates TLS is enabled, and you need to add an argument that points to
the root signer certificate of the certificate authority for the orderer
service.</p>
<p>Fortunately, an environment variable has been set for you within the CLI
container that sets the flag (<em>--tls</em> argument) and points to the
appropriate certificate (the <em>--cafile</em> argument) so that you can
simply pass both arguments by specifying the single short environment
variable name instead of having to enter the two arguments and the
tediously long argument value for <em>--cafile</em>.</p>
<p>Enter this command now to see the value of this environment variable,
and thank me later for setting this up for you:</p>
<pre><code>root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# echo $FABRIC_TLS 
--tls --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/blockchain.com/orderers/orderer.blockchain.com/msp/cacerts/ca.blockchain.com-cert.pem
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 5.5:</strong> Now enter this command:</p>
<pre><code>root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer channel create -o orderer.blockchain.com:7050  -f channel-artifacts/channel.tx  $FABRIC_TLS -c $CHANNEL_NAME

2018-10-22 18:54:06.608 UTC [cli.common] readBlock -&gt; INFO 002 Received block: 0
</code></pre>
<p>The last line before you get your command prompt back will contain the
words "Received block: 0". This indicates that your channel creation
was successful, and the peer received the initial, or <em>genesis</em> block
for the channel, which is block 0. Programmers love to start counting
things at zero instead of one- it makes them feel special.</p>
<p>Proceed to the next section where you will join each peer to the
channel.   </p>
<h1 id="section-6-instruct-each-peer-node-to-join-the-channel">Section 6 - Instruct each peer node to join the channel</h1>
<p>In the last section, you issued the <em>peer channel create</em> command from
one of the peers. Now any peer that you want to join the channel may
join- you will issue the <em>peer channel join</em> command from each peer.</p>
<p>For a peer to be eligible to join a channel, it must be a member of an
organization that is authorized to join the channel. When you created
your channel, you authorized <em>Org0MSP</em> and <em>Org1MSP</em> to join the
channel. Each of your four peers belongs to one of those two
organizations- two peers for each one- so they will be able to join
successfully. If someone from an organization other than <em>Org0MSP</em> or
<em>Org1MSP</em> attempted to join their peers to this channel, the attempt
would fail.</p>
<p>You are going to repeat the following steps for each of the four peer
nodes, in order to show that the peer successfully joined the channel:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <em>scripts/setpeer</em> script to point the CLI to the peer</li>
<li>Use the <em>peer channel list</em> command to show that the peer is not
    joined to any channels</li>
<li>Use the <em>peer channel join</em> command to join the peer to your channel</li>
<li>Use the <em>peer channel list</em> command again to see that the peer has
    joined your channel</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 6.1:</strong> Point the <em>cli</em> to <em>peer0</em> for <em>Org0MSP</em>:</p>

specified (or <em>mychannel</em> if you did not specify your own name), and
then the Docker Compose file is set up to pass this environment variable
to the <em>cli</em> container. If you are still on the happy path, your output

<h1 id="section-7-define-an-anchor-peer-for-each-organization-in-the-channel">Section 7 - Define an "anchor" peer for each organization in the channel</h1>
<p>An anchor peer for an organization is a peer that can be known by all
the other organizations in a channel. Not all peers for an organization
need to be defined as anchor peers. Peers from other organizations will
reach out to anchor peers which can then make information about the
other peers available.</p>
<p>In a production environment, an organization will typically define more
than one peer as an anchor peer for availability and resilience. In our
lab, we will just define one of the two peers for each organization as
an anchor peer.</p>
<p>The definition of an anchor peer took place back in section 4 when you
ran the <em>generateArtifacts.sh</em> script. Two of the output files from that
step were <em>Org0MSPanchors.tx</em> and <em>Org1MSPanchors.tx.</em> These are input
files to define the anchor peers for Org0MSP and Org1MSP respectively.
After the channel is created, each organization needs to run this
command. You will do that now- this process is a little bit confusing in
that the command to do this starts with <em>peer channel create ...</em> but
the command will actually <em>update</em> the existing channel with the
information about the desired anchor peer. Think of <em>peer channel
create</em> here as meaning, "create an update transaction for a channel".</p>

probably use the up arrow key a couple of times to retrieve that command
as an alternative to doing a copy-and-paste here, but I'll leave it up
to you:</p>
<pre><code>root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode list --installed

root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer#
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I won't have you repeat the "before" and "after" <em>peer
chaincode list --installed</em> commands on any of the other peers on which
you install it, but I won't take extraordinary measures to stop you if
you insist on doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8.5:</strong> Switch to <em>peer0</em> in <em>Org1MSP</em>:</p>

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 8.6:</strong> Install the marbles chaincode on Peer0 in Org1MSP. You are
looking for a message near the end of the output similar to what is
shown here:</p>
<pre><code>root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode install -n marbles -v 1.0 -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/marbles

</code></pre>
<p>An interesting thing to note is that for the <em>peer chaincode install</em>
command you did not need to specify the $FABRIC_TLS environment
variable. This is because this operation does not cause the peer to
communicate with the orderer. Also, you did not need to specify the
$CHANNEL_NAME environment variable. This is because the <em>peer
chaincode install</em> command only installs the chaincode on the peer node.
You only need to do this once per peer. That is, even if you wanted to
invoke the same chaincode on multiple channels on a peer, you only
install the chaincode once on that peer.</p>
<p>Installing chaincode on a peer is a necessary step, but not the only
step needed, in order to execute chaincode on that peer. The chaincode
must also be instantiated on a channel that the peer participates in.
You will do that in the next section.   </p>
<h1 id="section-9-instantiate-the-chaincode-on-the-channel">Section 9 - Instantiate the chaincode on the channel</h1>
<p>In the previous section, you installed chaincode on two of your four
peers. Chaincode installation is a peer-level operation. Chaincode
instantiation, however, is a channel-level operation. It only needs to
be performed once on the channel, no matter how many peers have joined
the channel. I'll try to prove it to you in this section.</p>
<p>Chaincode instantiation causes a transaction to occur on the channel, so
even if a peer on the channel does not have the chaincode installed, it
will be made aware of the instantiate transaction, and thus be aware
that the chaincode exists and be able to commit transactions from the
chaincode to the ledger- it just would not be able to endorse a
transaction on the chaincode.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9.1:</strong> You want to stay signed in to the <em>cli</em> Docker container;
however, you will also want to issue some Docker commands from your
Linux on IBM Z host, so at this time open up a second terminal session
and sign in to your Linux on IBM Z host. For the remainder of this lab,
I will refer to the session where you are in the <em>cli</em> Docker container
as <em>Terminal Session 1</em>, and this new session where you are at the Linux
on IBM Z host as <em>Terminal Session 2</em>. If you are running this lab from
a Windows laptop you probably are using PuTTY. If you are running this
lab from Linux or MacOS you are probably using terminal sessions and
using <em>ssh</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9.2:</strong> You are going to confirm that you do not have any
chaincode Docker images created, nor any Docker chaincode containers
running currently. From Terminal Session 2, enter this command and
observe that all of your images begin with <em>hyperledger</em>:</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker images

</code></pre>
<p>You should not have any images which begin with <em>dev-</em>, which is what
your Docker chaincode images will start with, and at this point in the
lab Docker chaincode images have not been created yet.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9.3:</strong> Now do essentially the same thing with <em>docker ps</em> and you
should see all of the Docker containers for the Hyperledger Fabric
processes and CouchDB, but no chaincode-related Docker containers:</p>

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 9.4:</strong> Entering this will make this fact stand out more as you
should only see column headers in your output. (The <em>--invert-match</em>
argument for <em>grep</em> says "do not show me anything that contains the
string "hyperledger"):</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker ps --all | grep --invert-match hyperledger
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                       NAMES
</code></pre>
<p>Now that you have established that you have no chaincode-related Docker
images or containers present, try to instantiate the chaincode.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9.5:</strong> On Terminal Session 1, switch to Peer 0 of Org0MSP by
entering:</p>
<pre><code>root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# source scripts/setpeer 0 0
CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/ca.crt

CORE_PEER_ID=cli
CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG
CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.unitedmarbles.com:7051
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 9.6:</strong> On Terminal Session 1, enter this command to list
instantiated chaincodes on your channel. Spoiler alert- there aren't
any, so you will get an empty list:</p>
<pre><code>root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode list --instantiated --channelID ${CHANNEL_NAME}
Get instantiated chaincodes on channel mychannel:
root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer#
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 9.7:</strong> On Terminal Session 1, issue the command to instantiate
the chaincode on the channel:</p>
<pre><code>root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode instantiate -o orderer.blockchain.com:7050 -n marbles -v 1.0 -c '{"Args":["init","1"]}' -P "OR ('Org0MSP.member','Org1MSP.member')" $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME
2018-10-22 19:16:30.024 UTC [chaincodeCmd] checkChaincodeCmdParams -&gt; INFO 001 Using default escc
2018-10-22 19:16:30.024 UTC [chaincodeCmd] checkChaincodeCmdParams -&gt; INFO 002 Using default vscc
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In your prior commands, when specifying the channel name, you
used lowercase 'c' as the argument, e.g., <em>-c $CHANNEL_NAME</em>. In the
<em>peer chaincode instantiate</em> command however, you use an uppercase 'C'
as the argument to specify the channel name, e.g., <em>-C mychannel</em>,
because -c is used to specify the arguments given to the chaincode. Why
<em>c</em> for arguments you may ask? Well, the '<em>c</em>' is short for '<em>ctor</em>',
which itself is an abbreviation for <em>constructor</em>, which is a fancy word
object-oriented programmers use to refer to the initial arguments given
when creating an object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9.8:</strong> You may have noticed a longer than usual pause before you
got your command prompt back while that last command was being run. The
reason for this is that as part of the instantiate, a Docker image for
the chaincode is created and then a Docker container is started from the
image. To prove this to yourself, on Terminal Session 2, enter this to
see the new Docker image:</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker images dev-*

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 9.9:</strong> And enter this to see the Docker chaincode container
created from the new Docker image:</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker ps | grep --invert-match hyperledger 
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                                                                      COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                       NAMES

bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$
</code></pre>
<p>The naming convention used by Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.0 for the Docker
images it creates for chaincode is
<em>HyperledgerFabricNetworkName-PeerName-ChaincodeName-ChaincodeVersion-SHA256Hash</em>.
In our case of <em>dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0-</em>, the default
name of a Hyperledger Fabric network is <em>dev</em>, and you did not change
it. <em>peer0.unitedmarbles.com</em> is the peer name of peer0 of Org0MSP, and
you specified this via the CORE_PEER_ID environment variable in the
Docker Compose YAML file. <em>marbles</em> is the name you gave this chaincode
in the <em>-n</em> argument of the <em>peer chaincode install</em> command, and <em>1.0</em>
is the version of the chaincode you used in the <em>-v</em> argument of the
<em>peer chaincode install</em> command.</p>
<p>Note that a chaincode Docker container was only created for the peer on
which you entered the <em>peer chaincode instantiate</em> command. Docker
containers will not be created on the other peers until you run a <em>peer
chaincode invoke</em> or <em>peer chaincode query</em> command on that peer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9.10:</strong> In Terminal Session 1 repeat the command from <em>Step 9.6</em>
to see that your instantiated chaincode on your channel is now listed:</p>
<pre><code>root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode list --instantiated --channelID ${CHANNEL_NAME}
Get instantiated chaincodes on channel mychannel:

root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer#
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 9.11:</strong> Remember when I said at the beginning of this section
that I would try to prove it to you that you only need to do the
<em>instantiate</em> once on a channel, and not on every peer in the channel?
Let's find out if I'm lying. You did the <em>instantiate</em> on peer "0
0". Switch to another peer:</p>
<pre><code>root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# source scripts/setpeer 1 1

CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 9.12:</strong> Repeat the command from <em>Step 9.10</em> on this peer, and
even though you did not run the <em>peer chaincode instantiate</em> on this
peer, you will see that this peer is aware of the instantiation:</p>
<pre><code>root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode list --instantiated --channelID ${CHANNEL_NAME}
Get instantiated chaincodes on channel mychannel:

</code></pre>
<p>I would never lie to you.</p>
<h1 id="section-10-invoke-chaincode-functions">Section 10 - Invoke chaincode functions</h1>
<p>You are now ready to invoke chaincode functions that will create, read,
update and delete data in the ledger.</p>
<p>In this section, you will enter <em>scripts/setpeer</em> and <em>peer chaincode
commands</em> in Terminal session 1, while you will enter <em>docker ps</em> and
<em>docker images</em> commands in Terminal session 2.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10.1:</strong> Switch to peer0 of Org0MSP:</p>

<p><strong>Step 10.2:</strong> You will use the marbles chaincode to create a new
Marbles owner named John. If you would like to use a different name than
John, that is fine but then there will be other places later where you
would need to use your "custom" name instead of John. And John's the
guy who first got this lab working about three years ago so I think he
deserves a marble, don't you, so if you do want to show off and change
the name then I'm going to let you figure out later where it might need
to be changed.</p>
<p>Enter this command in Terminal session 1:</p>
<pre><code>root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{"Args":["init_owner", "o0000000000001","John","Marbles Inc"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME
2018-10-22 19:24:22.227 UTC [chaincodeCmd] InitCmdFactory -&gt; INFO 001 Retrieved channel (mychannel) orderer endpoint: orderer.blockchain.com:7050
2018-10-22 19:24:22.240 UTC [chaincodeCmd] chaincodeInvokeOrQuery -&gt; INFO 002 Chaincode invoke successful. result: status:200
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 10.3:</strong> Let's deconstruct the arguments to the chaincode:</p>
<pre><code>{“Args”:[“init_owner”, “o0000000000001”, “John”, “Marbles Inc”]}
</code></pre>
<p>This is in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and
is a very popular format for transmitting data in many languages, not
just with JavaScript. What is shown above is a single name/value pair.
The name is <em>Args</em> and the value is an array of four arguments. (The
square brackets "[" and "]" specify an array in JSON).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the formal JSON definition the term '<em>name/value</em>' is used,
but many programmers will also use the term '<em>key/value</em>' instead. You
can consider these two terms as synonymous. (Many people use the phrase
"the same" instead of the word "synonymous").</p>
<p>The <em>Args</em> name specifies the arguments passed to the chaincode
invocation. There is an interface layer, also called a "shim", that
gains control before passing it along to user-written chaincode
functions- it expects this <em>Args</em> name/value pair.</p>
<p>The shim also expects the first array value to be the name of the
user-written chaincode function that it will pass control to, and then
all remaining array values are the arguments to pass, in order, to that
user-written chaincode function.</p>
<p>So, in the command you just entered, the <em>init_owner</em> function is
called, and it is passed three arguments, <em>o0000000000001</em>, <em>John</em>, and
<em>Marbles Inc</em>.</p>
<p>It is logic within the <em>init_owner</em> function that cause updates to the
channel's ledger- subject to the transaction flow in Hyperledger Fabric
v1.4.0- that is, chaincode execution causes proposed updates to the
ledger, which are only committed at the end of the transaction flow if
everything is validated properly. But it all starts with function calls
inside the chaincode functions that ask for ledger state to be created
or updated.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10.4:</strong> Go to Terminal session 2, and enter this Docker command
and you will observe that you still only have a Docker image and a
Docker container for peer0 of Org0MSP:</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker images dev-*
REPOSITORY                                                                                                 TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 10.5:</strong> Enter this command to see information about the chaincode
container. I introduce here the <em>--no-trunc</em> option, which stands for
<em>no truncation</em>, so you can see more information about the container:</p>
<pre><code>bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker ps --no-trunc | grep dev-
054fe600d195101a4e735bd213f433b41b40d7c1496bf325425e81fa5f789955   dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0-7e92f069adb7469939a96dcba723fa2019745461f05a562e81cec38e46424aa1   "chaincode -peer.address=peer0.unitedmarbles.com:7052"                                                                                                                                                                                                                About a minute ago   Up About a minute                                                                               dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0
</code></pre>
<p>The takeaway is that the chaincode execution has only run on peer0 of
Org0MSP so far, and this is also the peer on which you instantiated the
chaincode, so the Docker image for the chaincode, and the corresponding
Docker container based on the image, have been created for only this
peer. You will see soon that other peers will have their own chaincode
Docker image and Docker container built the first time they are needed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10.6:</strong> You created a marble owner in the previous step. Now
create a marble belonging to this owner. Perform this from peer0 of
Org1, so from Terminal session 1, switch to Peer0 of Org1MSP:</p>

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 10.7:</strong> Now enter the command to create a new marble for John:</p>
<pre><code>root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{"Args":["init_marble","m0000000000001","blue","35","o0000000000001","Marbles Inc"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME

</code></pre>
<p>This time you called the <em>init_marble</em> function. Now you have created
one owner, and one marble.</p>
<p>The owner is <em>John</em> (or your custom name) and his id is
<em>o0000000000001</em>, and his marble has an id of <em>m0000000000001</em>. I
cleverly decided that the letter '<em>o</em>' stands for owner and the letter
'<em>m</em>' stands for marbles. I put 12 leading zeros in front of the number
1 in case you wanted to stay late and create trillions of marbles and
owners.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10.8:</strong> In Terminal session 2, issue the command to see that you
have two Docker chaincode images:</p>

bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 10.10:</strong> You will create a new owner now. From Terminal Session
1, try it on Peer 1 of Org0MSP:</p>
<pre><code>root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# source scripts/setpeer 0 1

CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1.unitedmarbles.com:7051
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 10.11:</strong> Then run this command to try to create a new owner.
<strong>Note: This command is intended to fail. Go ahead and enter it and then
read on for why it failed and how to correct the failure</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{"Args":["init_owner","o0000000000002","Barry","United Marbles"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME
</code></pre>
<p>What do you expect to happen when you enter this command?</p>
<p>If you have followed these instructions exactly so far, the <em>invoke</em>
will fail. It will fail because you have not yet installed the chaincode
on Peer 1 of Org0. Here is the output which shows the error:</p>
<pre><code>2018-10-22 19:43:00.238 UTC [chaincodeCmd] InitCmdFactory -&gt; INFO 001 Retrieved channel (mychannel) orderer endpoint: orderer.blockchain.com:7050
Error: endorsement failure during invoke. response: status:500 message:"cannot retrieve package for chaincode marbles/1.0, error open /var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/marbles.1.0: no such file or directory"
</code></pre>
<p>You must first <em>install</em> chaincode on a peer not only before you can do
an <em>instantiate</em> from that peer, but also before you can do an <em>invoke</em>
or <em>query</em> from that peer. If you want a peer to perform the endorsing
function for a transaction, the chaincode for that transaction must be
installed on that peer. If that peer is a member of the channel on which
the chaincode is instantiated, but has not had the chaincode installed
on it, it will still perform the committer function and update its copy
of the channel's ledger when it receives valid transactions from the
orderer, but it cannot endorse transaction proposals unless the
chaincode has been installed on it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10.12</strong>: Correct things by installing the chaincode on peer1 of
Org0. In Terminal session 1, enter this command, which should look
familiar to you:</p>
<pre><code>root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode install -n marbles -v1.0 -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/marbles

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 10.13:</strong> Now, in Terminal session 1, repeat the <em>peer chaincode
invoke</em> command from <em>Step 10.9</em>. It should work this time:</p>
<pre><code>root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{"Args":["init_owner","o0000000000002","Barry","United Marbles"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME

<p><strong>Step 10.16:</strong> Try some additional chaincode invocations. You have had
enough experience switching between peers with <em>source scripts/setpeer</em>
and issuing the <em>peer chaincode invoke</em> command that I will not show the
output, nor tell you from which peer you should enter your command. I
will just list several more commands you can run against the marbles
chaincode. Feel free to switch amongst the four peers as you see fit
before you enter each command. Note however, that you have only
installed the chaincode on three of the four peers, so if you choose
that fourth peer, you will need to install the chaincode there first. I
won't tell you which peer does not currently have the chaincode
installed, but if you need a hint, it is the one that does not have a
Docker image built yet for its chaincode. (Note that checking for the
absence of a Docker image for a peer is not, by itself,proof that you
have not installed the chaincode on that peer- the Docker image is not
built until you first invoke a function against the chaincode on that
peer).</p>
<p>If you are ambitious and want to install the chaincode on that fourth
peer, try the useful Docker commands I have shown you from PuTTY session
2 to see that the chaincode's Docker image and Docker container are
created when you invoke a transaction on that fourth peer.</p>
<p>Try some or all of these commands from Terminal session 1:</p>
<p>Create a marble for Barry, i.e., owner o0000000000002:</p>
<pre><code>peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{"Args":["init_marble","m0000000000002","green","50","o0000000000002","United Marbles"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME
</code></pre>
<p>Obtain all marble information- marbles and owners:</p>
<pre><code>peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{"Args":["read_everything"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME
</code></pre>
<p>Change marble ownership- 'Barry' is giving his marble to 'John':</p>
<pre><code>peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{"Args":["set_owner","m0000000000002","o0000000000001","United Marbles"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME
</code></pre>
<p>Get the history of marble 'm0000000000002':</p>
<pre><code>peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{"Args":["getHistory","m0000000000002"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME
</code></pre>
<p>Delete marble 'm0000000000002':</p>
<pre><code>peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{"Args":["delete_marble","m0000000000002","Marbles Inc"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME
</code></pre>
<p>Try again to get the history of marble 'm0000000000002' after you just
deleted it:</p>
<pre><code>peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{"Args":["getHistory","m0000000000002"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME
</code></pre>
<p>Obtain all marble information again. See if it matches your expectations
based on the commands you have entered:</p>
<pre><code>peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{"Args":["read_everything"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 10.17:</strong> Exit the <em>cli</em> Docker container from Terminal session 1.
Your command prompt should change to reflect that you are now back at
your Linux on IBM Z host prompt and no longer in the Docker container:</p>
<pre><code>root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# exit
exit
bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 10.18:</strong> Congratulations for making it through the treacherous
portion of the lab!</p>
<p>Stay logged in to your two terminal sessions and leave your Hyperledger
Fabric network and all the chaincode Docker containers up and running-
you will use what you created here in Part 2 of the lab where you will
install a front-end application offering a browser-based UI from which
you will interact with the marbles chaincode that you have installed in
here in Part 1.</p>
