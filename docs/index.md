# Blockchain Immersion Wildfire Workshop
Welcome! This virtual workshop combines lectures and hands-on labs to teach you the fundamentals of blockchain for business. We provide an overview of Enterprise Blockchain that is based on the open source framework called Hyperledger Fabric. You have the opportunity to go through labs from a blockchain developer perspective and a blockchain network operator perspective. Additionally, you will learn about the IBM-specific offerings that leverage Hyperledger Fabric, and how our unique combination of expertise, governance and operations tooling, and infrastructure capabilities with Linux on Z can help you achieve business results faster and more securely.
