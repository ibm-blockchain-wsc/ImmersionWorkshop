# Welcome to the Hyperledger Fabric Lab

The goal of this lab is to give you hands on experience interacting with Hyperledger Fabric using the Hyperledger Fabric command line interface (CLI) and make you familiar with chaincode lifecycle operations such as *install*, *instantiate* and *invoke*. You will also have the opportunity to configure a front-end application that provides a browser-based user interface (UI) that uses the Application Programming Interface (API) provided by the Hyperledger Fabric Node.js Software Development Kit (SDK) to interact with chaincode.

This lab is broken into two parts. The first part deals with the chaincode and the second part deals with the front-end application. Please read the instructions carefully. In the shaded sections in the lab where command input and output is shown, the convention followed is that the first line of the shaded area will contain the command input after the command prompt, and any subsequent lines in the shaded area are the command output.  It will probably be easiest for you to copy the command input from the lab and paste it into your terminal window. Be careful not to accidentally copy in some of the command output from line two and beyond of the shaded area when you are doing this.

!!! note
	This lab runs on Linux on IBM Z systems in the IBM Washington Systems Center (WSC). In order to connect to this environment, you must use the CISCO AnyConnect client to establish a virtual private network (VPN) connection into the WSC network. You will be given connection information at the beginning of the lab.

!!! tip
	If you find any typos, errors, or just want to provide helpful feedback to make this lab better, please click on the GitHub icon in the lower left corner of this page to be taken to our GitHub repository, from where you can create an Issue to suggest a correction or improvement.  Thanks for your feedback!
