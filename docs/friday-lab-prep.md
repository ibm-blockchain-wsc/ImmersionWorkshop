Take a look at this presentation with attention to the slides noted below (right-click and then open in a new tab):
[Using IBM Blockchain Platform](files/UsingIBMBlockchainPlatform.pdf)

##Slides 11-15
These provide an overview of the IBM Blockchain Platform Console web user interface.

##Slides 18-20
These provide an overview of the network you will be building in the lab.

On *Slide 20*, several roles are listed.  You will be "wearing the hat" of each of those roles at various steps in the lab.

##Notes on other, optional, slides:

###Slides 1-10
These were covered prior to Wednesday's labs

###Slides 16-17
These discuss Kubernetes, and you will not have visibility into Kubernetes in this lab.  (You will be creating Kubernetes objects throughout the lab but the details of these objects are not visible to you).

###Slides 21+
Most of the activities in these steps will be covered in the lab so there is no need to dwell on these slides unless you're curious.

One difference between these slides and your lab experience is that the slides take the perspective of a real life scenario where each organization has its own console instance, and in order to cooperate with the other organizations, each organization will need to export configuration information about their nodes and send this to the other organizations who must then import this into their console.  In the lab, you will be administering all three organizations from a single console instance, so you will not have to do the exports and imports. (See, e.g., slide 28).
