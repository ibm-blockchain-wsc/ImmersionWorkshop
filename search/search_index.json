OK Configuring helm: /root/.helm OK Take a look at your peer setup environment variables In order to operate your peer a number of environment variables need to be set. Let's take a look at some of the environment variables set for the Hyperledger Fabric cli to work with your peer: env | grep \"CORE\\|FABRIC\" Sample Output: CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=org0 FABRIC_CFG_PATH=/home/fabric-ca-client/fabric-binaries/config CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/home/org0/admin CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/home/org0/peertls.pem CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=192.168.22.81:30787 CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID defines the local MSP or Membership Services Provider of the peer which contains the identifying information (i.e., certs and keys) for the peer as well as the certificates of trusted Certificate Authorities which are authorized to issue identities on behalf of the organization. (In the sample output above org0 is the MSPID, yours will correspond with your team) FABRIC_CFG_PATH=/home/fabric-ca-client/fabric-binaries/config defines the config path that holds config files such as core.yaml required for some fabric binary tools such as the peer command used in peer chaincode list --installed below. CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true is used to enable transport layer security (TLS) communication. CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH points to the MSP material you are using to operate the peer CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE is the path to the root TLS certificate for the peer which your system needs to trust to have a TLS connection with the peer. CORE_PEER_ADDRESS is the peer's IP address used to connect with the peer. Additionally, a few more variables are set for ease of use in later commands. You can see the values of these variables with the command below: env | grep \"CHANNEL\\|CC_NAME\\|ORDERER_CA\\|ORDERER_1\\|team\\|credential\" | grep -v \"DOCKER\" Sample Output: ORDERER_1=192.168.22.81:30634 CC_NAME=marbles CHANNEL=mychannel team=team00 ORDERER_CA=/home/org0/ordererca.pem credential=p@ssw0rd ORDERER_1 is the orderer's IP address used to connect to the orderer. CC_NAME is the name of the chaincode that we are targeting on the channel. CHANNEL is the name of the channel we are targeting. Remember a channel in Hyperledger Fabric is it's own subnetwork of communication with its own ledger. team is the name of the team that you are a part of for this lab which is used to differentiate between different lab members. ORDERER_CA is the path to the root TLS certificate for the orderer which your system needs to trust to have a TLS connection with the orderer. credential is the password you will use to authenticate to the cluster for both the private docker registry as well as the Kubernetes API server. Check the chaincode on the peer and the channel In order to check which chaincode is installed on your peer run: peer chaincode list --installed Sample Output: Get installed chaincodes on peer: Name: marbles, Version: 1.0, Path: marbles, Id: 4421fd51a7949b08620ab8db7407d1269c38e4ef2edd143b1a78d56ae82eaa2d You will notice the marbles chaincode has been installed on your peer. Next, let's check which chaincode is instantiated on the channel: peer chaincode list --instantiated -C $CHANNEL Sample Output: Get instantiated chaincodes on channel mychannel: Name: marbles, Version: 1.0, Path: marbles, Escc: escc, Vscc: vscc Here, you see the marbles chaincode has also been instantiated on the channel and is ready to be used to submit transactions. Submit transactions with the peer to create yourself as a marbles owner with a marble of your own Now it's time for one of your team members to add yourself as a marbles owner to the channel. First set your name as the marbles owner owner=Garrett Then create the owner with the following command: peer chaincode invoke -C ${CHANNEL} -n ${CC_NAME} -c '{ Args :[ init_owner , o0'$team' , '$owner' , '$CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID' ]}' --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA -o ${ORDERER_1} Sample Output: 2019-03-08 03:47:55.093 UTC [chaincodeCmd] chaincodeInvokeOrQuery - INFO 001 Chaincode invoke successful. result: status:200 Next, give your owner a black marble: peer chaincode invoke -C ${CHANNEL} -n ${CC_NAME} -c '{ Args :[ init_marble , m0'$team' , black , 200 , o0'$team' , '$CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID' ]}' --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA -o ${ORDERER_1} Sample Output 2019-03-08 03:48:02.027 UTC [chaincodeCmd] chaincodeInvokeOrQuery - INFO 001 Chaincode invoke successful. result: status:200 Finally, run a query against the ledger to see your owner and marble as well as everyone else's so far: peer chaincode invoke -C ${CHANNEL} -n ${CC_NAME} -c '{ Args :[ read_everything ]}' --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA -o ${ORDERER_1} Sample Output: 2019-03-15 08:47:04.730 UTC [chaincodeCmd] chaincodeInvokeOrQuery - INFO 001 Chaincode invoke successful. result: status:200 payload: {\\ owners\\ :[{\\ docType\\ :\\ marble_owner\\ ,\\ id\\ :\\ o015525575491703BpSw\\ ,\\ username\\ :\\ rick\\ ,\\ company\\ :\\ org0\\ ,\\ enabled\\ :true} Note: This will grow as more marbles and owners get added to the ledger by your org and other orgs. Configure the marbles application to connect to your peer Go into the marbles directory: cd marbles/config The marbles application will connect to your fabric network using the Hyperledger Fabric Node.js Software Development Kit (SDK) Application Programming Interface (API) by consuming information in the file connection_profile_tls.json Take a look at this file with cat connection_profile_tls.json Take note that this file has connection information and TLS certificates for your, peers, certificate authority (CA), and the orderer for your network. Next, you will be able to specify which users you want to enroll in your application. Edit the file marbles_tls.json to do this: vim marbles_tls.json Edit the names to what you want in the usernames section such as: { cred_filename : connection_profile_tls.json , use_events : true, keep_alive_secs : 120, usernames : [ Beth , Rick , Jerry ], port : 3001 } In vim you edit by typing i and then making your changes using the arrow keys to navigate. Once you are finished making changes hit the escape key. Then save your changes with a save command such as :x , holding down shift and typing ZZ ( shift + ZZ ), shift + ZQ or using the worst option :wq . Once the file has been saved, move back to the parent directory with cd .. Connect the marbles application to your peer Run npm install -g gulp This will install the gulp npm package necessary to run the marbles application. Run npm install This will install the dependencies for the marbles application specified in the package.json file in the /home/marbles directory. This may take a few minutes. You will notice a bunch of CXX(target) in the output of this command because two of the packages (i.e., pkcs11js and grpc) needs to be compiled from source for s390x. This needs to happen since the binaries are not publicly available for this platform. When this command completes it will return your terminal to you. Now you can start the marbles application with gulp marbles_tls Open up a web browser on your pc and navigate to the ip given to you earlier at port 3000 in the form xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3000 where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is your given ip address with each x being a possible digit (e.g., 192.168.22.150:3000 ). First, choose Express to setup your marbles application Here you can see your org, the owners and marbles you created in the marbles_tls.json file and the marble and owner you created with the cli. You created a black marble with the cli and the application randomly selects a color for the marbles created from the marbles_tls.json file (in this case black, but your mileage with the random function may vary) We can also see the other orgs and their marbles that are connected in this connectathon. Next turn on story mode to see the marble transaction process: Click on settings Enable Story Mode Finally, trade some marbles to other users. Click on a marble from a user in your org and drag it to another user in your org Click and drag a marble from a member in your org and move it to a member of a different org Click and drag a marble from a member of a different org and drag it to a member of your org Notice that you can give marbles to other orgs but can't take them and think about why this may be the case... Now close the application by returning to your terminal and typing ctrl + c to return your terminal prompt. You have now setup the marbles application. Please move on to part 2 where you will deploy this into your cluster.","title":"Part 1"},{"location":"connect-part1/#overview","text":"The goal of this part of the lab is to go through the process of using your peer with the fabric command line interface (cli) tools and connecting it with marbles.

Both should be in Running status. Your organization only has one peer in this scenario. Build a docker image Now that you have tested the Marbles front end User Interface (Marbles UI, for short), let's save it as a docker image using the supplied Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Think of it as a specific way to package up a set of files and instructions that together make up a microservice. Go to your marbles directory: cd /home/marbles Here you should see a Dockerfile: ls -ltr Dockerfile Sample Output: -rw-rw-r-- 1 1000 1000 394 Feb 28 22:12 Dockerfile If you are curious, cat the file to look at its contents: cat Dockerfile Sample Output: FROM node:8-alpine ENV NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL warn RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app WORKDIR /usr/src/app COPY package.json /usr/src/app/ RUN apk add --no-cache --virtual .build-deps make gcc g++ python \\ npm install --silent \\ npm install gulp -g ---unsafe-perm \\ apk del .build-deps .build-deps make gcc g++ python COPY . /usr/src/app/ EXPOSE 3001 CMD [ gulp , marbles_tls ] The above Dockerfile builds from an Alpine node image already out there in DockerHub. This is a bare bones Linux image of the Alpine distribution with node version 8 installed. Next, the NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL for npm is globally set to warn so that npm will only print errors and warnings. ENV is used for this to persist this change as an environment variable in your finished container. Then, it uses RUN to run a command inside of the base node:8-alpine container to make a directory for the marbles application. WORKDIR makes this directory the current working directory. Moreover, COPY brings the package.json file (containing the names of the application's dependent node modules) into the containers /usr/src/app directory. The following RUN command uses apk (Alpine's package manager) to install a variety of pre-reqs to your npm install such as make, gcc and python, before running the actual npm install twice to install both the necessary node modules needed by the Marbles UI itself and gulp to start the marbles UI. Note that this is all done in one line with to make it occur in one layer. This way, at the end of the RUN you can use a delete command apk del and take the developer tools you no longer need out of your image. If you instead ran this as multiple commands, you would not be able to shrink your image size since previous layers can't be effectively deleted due to the layered file system. Finally, you copy the application itself and the connection profile materials into your working directory, document the port you will run marbles on ( 3001 ), and set a command for the container to run when it starts gulp marbles_tls . Now let's run docker build in the /home/marbles directory: docker build -t marbles-$team . NOTE: Please remember to not forget that pesky . Otherwise you will get an error saying \"docker build\" requires exactly 1 argument Sample Output: Sending build context to Docker daemon 261.9MB Step 1/9 : FROM node:8-alpine --- 66f08ecb7600 Step 2/9 : ENV NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL warn --- Using cache --- 180c28267c41 Step 3/9 : RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app --- Using cache --- f9615b4a1813 Step 4/9 : WORKDIR /usr/src/app --- Using cache --- e53d507c2bf9 .... .... lots more messages ....

Kubernetes objects are defined in yaml files and then created on or applied to a running cluster. You can create a Kubernetes resource from the ICP Console as well. But here you will do this via the command line tool kubectl which interacts with the Kubernetes API Server on the cluster. Now run the following command to create a marbles deployment yaml file that matches your team name. cat marbles-teamNN.yaml | sed -r 's/teamNN/'$team'/' marbles-$team.yaml You can cat the yaml file to see its contents: cat marbles-$team.yaml Sample Output: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: marbles-team00-svc spec: selector: app: marbles-team00 ports: - protocol: TCP port: 3001 targetPort: 3001 type: NodePort --- apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: marbles-team00-deploy labels: app: marbles-team00 spec: selector: matchLabels: app: marbles-team00 replicas: 1 template: metadata: labels: app: marbles-team00 spec: containers: - name: marbles-team00 image: wsc-ibp-icp-cluster.icp:8500/lab-test/marbles-team00:1.0 ports: - containerPort: 3001 imagePullPolicy: Always The important parts to point out in the yaml file are that it will create a Kubernetes service called marbles-team00-svc and that it is pointing to the marbles-team00 container. The service will be of type NodePort which means this service will be reachable outside of the cluster. The yaml file will also create a Kubernetes deployment that has one pod with one container that will be based off of the wsc-ibp-icp-cluster.icp:8500/lab-test/marbles-team00:1.0 image that you pushed to the private registry earlier. Deploy the service and test the Marbles UI Now you are ready to create the Kubernetes resources. Run the following command: kubectl apply -f marbles-$team.yaml service/marbles-team00-svc created deployment.extensions/marbles-team00-deploy created The deployment will create one pod that has one container. A service is also created.

Find your team's deployment, it should be similar to marbles-team00-deploy but with your team name. Click on your deployment. You will be taken to the details page of your deployment. Upon further exploration you will see the deployment has one ReplicaSet, and one Pod. You can choose to click into either the ReplicaSet or Pod to get details about those two objects. Now click on the Launch button for your deployment. This will bring up the Marbles UI. At this point, depending on where the other classroom students are, you will see two or more organizations in the Marbles UI. Test out the application by transacting some marbles with your neighboring students. Enabling Story Mode in Settings will provide a step by step guided experience during each transaction.

This is a bare bones Linux image of the Alpine distribution with node version 8 installed. Next, the NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL for npm is globally set to warn so that npm will only print errors and warnings. ENV is used for this to persist this change as an environment variable in your finished container. Then, it uses RUN to run a command inside of the base node:8-alpine container to make a directory for the marbles application. WORKDIR makes this directory the current working directory. Moreover, COPY brings the package.json file (containing the names of the application's dependent node modules) into the containers /usr/src/app directory. The following RUN command uses apk (Alpine's package manager) to install a variety of pre-reqs to your npm install such as make, gcc and python, before running the actual npm install twice to install both the necessary node modules needed by the Marbles UI itself and gulp to start the marbles UI. Note that this is all done in one line with to make it occur in one layer. This way, at the end of the RUN you can use a delete command apk del and take the developer tools you no longer need out of your image. If you instead ran this as multiple commands, you would not be able to shrink your image size since previous layers can't be effectively deleted due to the layered file system.

Hyperledger Fabric is one of several projects within the open-source Hyperledger collaborative effort hosted by the Linux Foundation. Hyperledger Fabric provides the distributed ledger, a.k.a. blockchain, technology that is the core of IBM Blockchain solutions and services. Below is a diagram that depicts the blockchain network you will build and operate: You will use Docker Compose to bring up a Hyperledger Fabric network in which two organizations will participate. There will be one orderer service for the entire network, and each organization will use its own certificate authority service and have two peer nodes. Each peer node will use CouchDB for its ledger store. Each peer node's CouchDB will run in a separate Docker container. That makes eleven Docker containers, as follows: 1 orderer service Docker container 2 certificate authority (CA) Docker containers (one for each organization) 4 peer node Docker containers (each of the two organizations has two peers) 4 CouchDB Docker containers (each peer node has its own separate CouchDB ledger store) You will also bring up a twelfth Docker container that we will call the cli container. You will use it as a convenience to enter Hyperledger Fabric commands targeted to specific peers. You will see how this is done later in the lab. The network you bring up will use Transport Layer Security (TLS) which provides secure, encrypted communications between the peer nodes and the orderer, just as most production implementations will require. You will install the Marbles chaincode on the peer nodes, instantiate the chaincode, and invoke functions of the chaincode. I will explain later in the lab the difference between the install and instantiate actions and what each one does. Section 2 - Description of the subsequent sections in Part 1 This section provides a brief description of the subsequent sections in Part 1 of the lab, where you will get hands-on experience with the Hyperledger Fabric command line interface (CLI). In most production implementations you would perform many of these functions through other means, such as programmatically through an Application Programming Interface (API) provided by a Hyperledger Fabric Software Development Kit (SDK), which the project provides for the Node.js, Java, Golang and Python programming languages, or perhaps through a user interface such as the one provided by the IBM Blockchain Platform. But using the CLI, as you will in this lab, is a great way to learn about how Hyperledger Fabric works. You will extract the artifacts necessary to run the lab in Section 3. All the artifacts necessary for the lab are provided in a compressed tarball- in essence, a zip file. You will use Docker Compose in Section 4 to bring up the twelve Docker containers that comprise the Hyperledger Fabric network. You will see that all twelve Docker containers that I mentioned in Section 1 are brought up with a single docker-compose command, and I will explain some of the more interesting bits of what is going on under the covers. You will create a channel in the Hyperledger Fabric network in Section 5. In Hyperledger Fabric, each channel is essentially its own blockchain. You will instruct each peer node to join the channel in Section 6. We will join all four Peer nodes to the channel. Peer nodes can be members of more than one channel, but for this lab you are only creating one channel. You will define an \"anchor\" peer for each organization in the channel in Section 7. An anchor peer for an organization is a peer that is known by all the other organizations in a channel. Not all peers for an organization need to be known by outside organizations. Peers not defined as anchor peers are visible only within their own organization. You will install the chaincode on the peer nodes in Section 8. Installing chaincode simply puts the chaincode executable on the file system of the peer. It is a necessary step before you execute that chaincode on the peer, but the next step is also required. You will instantiate the chaincode on the channel in Section 9. This step is a prerequisite to being able to run chaincode on a channel. It only needs to be performed on one peer that is a member of the channel. This causes a transaction to be recorded on the channel's blockchain to indicate that the chaincode can be run on the channel. You will invoke functions on the chaincode that will create, read, update and delete (CRUD) data stored on the blockchain in Section 10. Blocks of transactions in a blockchain are always added (i.e., created), and they can be read, but they are never, in normal operations, updated or deleted. However, although the blocks in a chain are not updated or deleted, the transactions themselves operate on Key/Value pairs that can have all CRUD operations performed on them. This collection of Key/Value pairs is often referred to as state data. Section 3 - Extract the artifacts necessary to run the lab Log in to your assigned Linux on Z Ubuntu instance with the instructions provided to you by your class instructor. If you are using Linux or MacOS you will likely be using ssh to log in via a Terminal window. If you are using Windows, you will most likely be using a PuTTY terminal session. If you are trying this lab at home, I am assuming you can figure out how to log in. All of the following instructions in the lab assume that you have successfully logged in to the Linux on Z Ubuntu instance assigned to your team. As you proceed through the lab, you will have to be logged in to more than one terminal session. When that becomes necessary, simply follow the same procedure used to log in to your first terminal session. Let's get started! Step 3.1: Navigate to the home directory by entering cd ~ (the \"tilde\" character, i.e., ' ~ ', represents the user's home directory in Linux). This directory is also usually set in the $HOME environment variable, so cd $HOME will also usually get you to your home directory: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ cd ~ bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ Note: You may already be in your home directory prior to entering cd ~ , in which case you'll just stay there- not a problem. Step 3.2: Retrieve the zmarbles compressed tarball prepared for this lab with the following command: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-blockchain-wsc/ImmersionWorkshop/master/zmarbles.tar.gz --2019-03-24 17:55:04-- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-blockchain-wsc/ImmersionWorkshop/master/zmarbles.tar.gz Resolving raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)... 151.101.248.133 Connecting to raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)|151.101.248.133|:443... connected.

Prove it with this ls command: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ ls zmarbles ls: cannot access 'zmarbles': No such file or directory Step 3.4: Extract the zmarbles.tar.gz file which will create the missing directory (and lots of subdirectories). If you want to see the name of all of the files and directories that are extracted, add the \" v \" switch into the options in the command below. That is, use -xzvf instead of -xzf . So, enter the tar command below as shown, feeling free to substitute -xzvf for -xzf in the command (the \" v \" is for \" verbose \") : bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ tar -xzf zmarbles.tar.gz Step 3.5: List the zmarbles directory with this command: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ ls -l zmarbles total 64 drwxr-xr-x 2 bcuser bcuser 4096 Jan 19 09:10 base drwxrwxr-x 2 bcuser bcuser 4096 Jan 14 07:54 bin drwxr-xr-x 2 bcuser bcuser 4096 Jan 21 07:03 channel-artifacts drwxrwxr-x 2 bcuser bcuser 4096 Jul 3 2018 config -rw-r--r-- 1 bcuser bcuser 12209 Jul 30 16:15 configtx.yaml -rw-r--r-- 1 bcuser bcuser 4175 Jul 30 17:32 crypto-config.yaml -rw-r--r-- 1 bcuser bcuser 6304 Jan 19 09:10 docker-compose-template.yaml drwxr-xr-x 3 bcuser bcuser 4096 Jun 18 2017 examples -rwxr-xr-x 1 bcuser bcuser 3587 Sep 24 13:53 generateArtifacts.sh drwxr-xr-x 2 bcuser bcuser 4096 Oct 1 2017 hostScripts drwxrwxr-x 9 bcuser bcuser 4096 Jan 21 07:03 marblesUI drwxr-xr-x 2 bcuser bcuser 4096 Jan 19 14:58 scripts An explanation of the purpose of each of these files and directories is given here: The base directory contains Docker Compose files that are included in the docker-compose-template.yaml file with the extends directive. The bin directory contains two executable programs, cryptogen and configtxgen , that will be run later when you execute the generateArtifacts.sh script. The channel-artifacts directory is empty, but it must exist when the generateArtifacts.sh script, which you will run later, invokes the configtxgen utility. The configtxgen utility generates input to channel configuration transaction inputs, and it is expecting the channel-artifacts directory to exist. The configtx.yaml file is input to the configtxgen utility The cryto-config.yaml file is input to the cryptogen utiity, which is called by the generateArtifacts.sh script to create cryptographic material (in the form of X.509 certificates and public and private key pairs) used to identify peers, orderers, and administrative and regular users of a Hyperledger Fabric network. The docker-compose-template.yaml file is used as a template file that the generateArtifacts.sh script will use to create the main Docker Compose template file, docker-compose.yaml , which contains definitions for all of the Docker containers that you will need. The examples directory contains the actual Marbles chaincode within its subdirectory structure. The generateArtifacts.sh script is used to generate channel configuration transaction input and to generate cryptographic material and it also creates docker-compose.yaml , using docker-compose-template.yaml as input. The hostScripts directory is not used in this lab. The marblesUI directory is used in the next lab, in which you will be working with the brwoser-based user interface (UI) for Marbles. The scripts directory contains a script named setpeer that you will be using throughout this lab from within the cli Docker container. setpeer will be explained in Section 5 . \u2003 Section 4 - Bring up the twelve Docker containers that comprise the Hyperledger Fabric network Step 4.1: Change to the zmarbles directory with the cd command: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ cd zmarbles/ bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ Step 4.2: You are going to run a script named generateArtifacts.sh that will create some configuration information that is necessary to get your Hyperledger Fabric network set up. There is one optional parameter you may pass to the script, and that is the name of the channel you will be creating. If you do not specify this parameter, the channel name defaults to mychannel . You may choose to specify your own channel name. E.g., if you wished to name your channel tim , then you would enter ./generateArtifacts.sh tim instead of just ./generateArtifacts.sh when directed below to enter the command. Note: If you pick your own channel name, it must start with a lowercase character, and only contain lowercase characters, numbers, or the dash ('-') character, or the period ('.'). So, enter the command below, optionally specifying a custom channel name (not shown here) as the lone argument to the generateArtifacts.sh script: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ source ./generateArtifacts.sh # specify a custom channel name or accept the default value of 'mychannel' Using cryptogen - /home/bcuser/zmarbles/bin/cryptogen ########################################################## ##### Generate certificates using cryptogen tool ######### ########################################################## unitedmarbles.com marblesinc.com Using configtxgen - /home/bcuser/zmarbles/bin/configtxgen ########################################################## ######### Generating Orderer Genesis block ############## ########################################################## 2018-10-22 14:08:39.575 EDT [common.tools.configtxgen] main - WARN 001 Omitting the channel ID for configtxgen for output operations is deprecated.

So, if you see me place comments after any commands you do not have to enter them but if you do, it will not hurt anything. This script calls two Hyperledger Fabric utilites- cryptogen , which creates security material (certificates and keys) and configtxgen (Configuration Transaction Generator), which is called four times, to create four things: An orderer genesis block -- this will be the first block on the orderer's system channel. The location of this block is specified to the Orderer when it is started up via the ORDERER_GENERAL_GENESISFILE environment variable. A channel transaction -- later in the lab, this is sent to the orderer and will cause a new channel to be created when you run the peer channel create command. An anchor peer update for Org0MSP. An anchor peer is a peer that is set up so that peers from other organizations may communicate with it. The concept of anchor peers allows an organization to create multiple peers, perhaps to provide extra capacity or throughput or resilience (or all the above) but not have to advertise this to outside organizations. An anchor peer update for Org1MSP. You will perform the anchor peer updates for both Org0MSP and Org1MSP later in the lab via peer channel create commands. Step 4.3: Issue the following command which will show you all files that were created by the configtxgen utility when it was called from inside generateArtifacts.sh : bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ ls -ltr channel-artifacts total 28 -rw-r--r-- 1 bcuser bcuser 12787 Oct 22 14:08 genesis.block -rw-r--r-- 1 bcuser bcuser 346 Oct 22 14:08 channel.tx -rw-r--r-- 1 bcuser bcuser 285 Oct 22 14:08 Org0MSPanchors.tx -rw-r--r-- 1 bcuser bcuser 282 Oct 22 14:08 Org1MSPanchors.tx genesis.block will be passed to the orderer at startup, and will be used to configure the orderer's system channel . This file contains the x.509 signing certificates for every organization defined within the consortia that were specified within the configtx.yaml file when configtxgen was run. The system channel contains other values such as parameters defining when a block of transactions is cut- e.g., based on time, number of transactions, or block size- and these values serve as a template, that is, as defaults, for any additional channels that might be created, if a new channel creation request does not provide its own custom values. channel.tx is the input for a configuration transaction that will create a channel. You will use this as input to a peer channel create request in Section 5 . Org0MSPanchors.tx and Org1MSPanchors.tx are inputs for configuration transactions that will define an anchor peer for Org0 and Org1 respectively. You will use these inputs in Section 7 . Step 4.4: Issue the following command which will show you all files that were created by the cryptogen utility when it was called from inside generateArtifacts.sh . This command will show one screen at a time and pause- press the Enter key to scroll to the end, that is, until you get your command prompt back: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ ls -ltrR crypto-config | more . . (output not shown here) . Actually, these files were created before the files listed in the prior step, Step 4.3 , were created, because, among the many cryptographic artifacts created are the x.509 signing certificates for the organizations, which are baked into the genesis.block discussed in the prior step. You can see that there is a dizzying set of directories and files, containing things like CA root certificates, signing certificates, TLS certificates, corresponding private keys, and public keys, for certificate authorities, organizations, administrative and general users. A thorough discussion of them is beyond the scope of this lab. Note: This utiltity created crypto material for both organizations, including private keys that each organization would keep secret and never share with the other organizations. You have created this for both organizations on a single server for purposes of this lab, but in a production implementation each organization would create their own material separately so that they could indeed keep their private keys to themselves. Their public certificates, which are meant to be shared, are baked into the channel definitions for channels in which they participate. This allows peer nodes from all organizations in a channel to verify digital signatures of transaction requests and transaction endorsements from other organizations that are members of the channel. Step 4.5: You are going to look inside the Docker Compose configuration file a little bit. Enter the following command: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ vi -R docker-compose.yaml You can enter Ctrl-f to scroll forward in the file and Ctrl-b to scroll back in the file. The -R flag opens the file in read-only mode, so if you accidentally change something in the file, it's okay. It will not be saved. The statements within docker-compose.yaml are in a markup language called YAML , which stands for Y et A nother M arkup L anguage. (Who says nerds do not have a sense of humor). We will go over some highlights here. There are twelve \"services\", or Docker containers, defined within this file. They all start in column 3 and have several statements to describe them. For example, the first service defined is ca0 , and there are image , environment , ports , command , volumes , and container_name statements that describe it. If you scroll down in the file with Ctrl-f you will see all the services. Not every service has the same statements describing it. The twelve services are: ca0 -- The certificate authority service for \"Organization 0\" (unitedmarbles.com) ca1 -- The certificate authority service for \"Organization 1\" (marblesinc.com) orderer.blockchain.com -- The single ordering service that both organizations will use peer0.unitedmarbles.com -- The first peer node for \"Organization 0\" peer1.unitedmarbles.com -- The second peer node for \"Organization 0\" peer0.marblesinc.com -- The first peer node for \"Organization 1\" peer1.marblesinc.com -- The second peer node for \"Organization 1\" couchdb0 -- The CouchDB server for peer0.unitedmarbles.com couchdb1 -- The CouchDB server for peer1.unitedmarbles.com couchdb2 -- The CouchDB server for peer0.marblesinc.com couchdb3 -- The CouchDB server for peer1.marblesinc.com cli -- The Docker container from which you will enter Hyperledger Fabric command line interface (CLI) commands targeted towards a peer node. I will describe how several statements work within the file, but time does not permit me to address every single line in the file! image statements define which Docker image file the Docker container will be created from. Basically, the Docker image file is a static file that, once created, is read-only. A Docker container is based on a Docker image, and any changes to the file system within a Docker container are stored within the container. So, multiple Docker containers can be based on the same Docker image, and each Docker container keeps track of its own changes. For example, the containers built for the ca0 and ca1 service will both be based on the hyperledger/fabric-ca:1.4.0 Docker image because they both have this statement in their definition: image: hyperledger/fabric-ca:1.4.0 environment statements define environment variables that are available to the Docker container. The Hyperledger Fabric processes make ample use of environment variables. In general, you will see that the certificate authority environment variables start with FABRIC_CA , the orderer's environment variables start with ORDERER_GENERAL , and the peer node's environment variables start with CORE . These variables control behavior of the Hyperledger Fabric code, and in many cases, will override values that are specified in configuration files. Notice that all the peers and the orderer have an environment variable to specify that TLS is enabled- CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true for the peers and ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_ENABLED=true for the orderer. You will notice there are other TLS-related variables to specify private keys, certificates and root certificates. ports statements map ports on our Linux on IBM Z host to ports within the Docker container. The syntax is host port : Docker container port . For example, the service for ca1 has this port statement: ports: - \"8054:7054\" This says that port 7054 in the Docker container for the ca1 node will be mapped to port 8054 on your Linux on IBM Z host. This is how you can run two CA nodes in two Docker containers and four peer nodes in four Docker containers and keep things straight- within each CA node they are both using port 7054, and within each peer node Docker container, they are all using port 7051 for the same thing, but if you want to get to one of the peers from your host or even the outside world, you would target the appropriate host-mapped port. Note: To see the port mappings for the peers you have to look in base/docker-compose.yaml . See if you can figure out why. container_name statements are used to create hostnames that the Docker containers spun up by the docker-compose command use to communicate with each other. A separate, private network will be created by Docker where the 12 Docker containers can communicate with each other via the names specified by container_name . So, they do not need to worry about the port mappings from the ports statements- those are used for trying to get to the Docker containers from outside the private network created by Docker. volumes statements are used to map file systems on the host to file systems within the Docker container. Just like with ports, the file system on the host system is on the left and the file system name mapped within the Docker container is on the right. For example, look at this statement from the ca0 service: volumes: - ./crypto-config/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/ca/:/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config The security-related files that were created from the previous step where you ran generateArtifacts.sh were all within the crypto-config directory on your Linux on IBM Z host. The prior volumes statement is how this stuff is made accessible to the ca1 service that will run within the Docker container. Similar magic is done for the other services as well, except for the CouchDB services. extends statements are used by the peer nodes. What this does is merge in other statements from another file. For example, you may notice that the peer nodes do not contain an images statement. How does Docker know what Docker image file to base the container on? That is defined in the file, base/peer-base.yaml , specified in the extends section of base/docker-compose.yaml , which is specified in the extends section of docker-compose.yaml for the peer nodes. command statements define what command is run when the Docker container is started. This is how the actual Hyperledger Fabric processes get started. You can define default commands when you create the Docker image. This is why you do not see command statements for the cli service or for the CouchDB services. For the peer nodes, the command statement is specified in the base/peer-base.yaml file. working_dir statements define what directory the Docker container will be in when its startup commands are run. Again, defaults for this can be defined when the Docker image is created. When you are done reviewing the docker-compose.yaml file, exit the vi session by typing :q! (that's \"colon\", \"q\", \"exclamation point\") which will exit the file and discard any changes you may have accidentally made while browsing through the file. If :q! doesn't work right away, you may have to hit the escape key first before trying it. If that still doesn't work, ask an instructor for help- vi can be tricky if you are not used to it. If you would like to see what is in the base/docker-compose-base.yaml and base/peer-base.yaml files I mentioned, take a quick peek with vi -R base/docker-compose-base.yaml and vi -R base/peer-base.yaml and exit with the :q! key sequence when you have had enough. Step 4.6: Start the Hyperledger Fabric network by entering the command shown below: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ docker-compose up --detach Creating network \"zmarbles_default\" with the default driver Creating couchdb0 ... Creating couchdb1 ... Creating orderer.blockchain.com ... Creating couchdb0 Creating couchdb1 Creating orderer.blockchain.com Creating couchdb2 ... Creating ca_Org0 ...

Creating cli ... done Note: Depending upon the circumstances under which you run this lab, the Hyperledger Fabric Docker images required may be pulled down from the public Docker image repository, in which case you will observe messages, not shown above, that show the progress of the necessary downloads. Step 4.7: Verify that all twelve services are Up and none of them say Exited . The Exited status means something went wrong, and you should check with an instructor for help if you see any of them in Exited status. If, however, all twelve of your Docker containers are in Up status, as in the output below, you are ready to proceed to the next section: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ docker ps --all CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 91819c57c22c hyperledger/fabric-tools \"bash\" 59 seconds ago Up 58 seconds cli b62ea5779b10 hyperledger/fabric-peer \"peer node start\" About a minute ago Up 59 seconds 0.0.0.0:8051- 7051/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8052- 7052/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8053- 7053/tcp peer1.unitedmarbles.com d35dbd158520 hyperledger/fabric-peer \"peer node start\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 0.0.0.0:7051-7053- 7051-7053/tcp peer0.unitedmarbles.com f4421a4ec662 hyperledger/fabric-peer \"peer node start\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 0.0.0.0:10051- 7051/tcp, 0.0.0.0:10052- 7052/tcp, 0.0.0.0:10053- 7053/tcp peer1.marblesinc.com 0f3ab02c8ca9 hyperledger/fabric-peer \"peer node start\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 0.0.0.0:9051- 7051/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9052- 7052/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9053- 7053/tcp peer0.marblesinc.com 974005b9fdcf hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:s390x-0.4.14 \"tini -- /docker-ent\u2026\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:6984- 5984/tcp couchdb1 9eb2369169b1 hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:s390x-0.4.14 \"tini -- /docker-ent\u2026\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5984- 5984/tcp couchdb0 1c99d4adb8d3 hyperledger/fabric-ca \"sh -c 'fabric-ca-se\u2026\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 0.0.0.0:7054- 7054/tcp ca_Org0 e33ac4f4a133 hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:s390x-0.4.14 \"tini -- /docker-ent\u2026\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8984- 5984/tcp couchdb3 8adc89681b53 hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:s390x-0.4.14 \"tini -- /docker-ent\u2026\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:7984- 5984/tcp couchdb2 6d32410a76aa hyperledger/fabric-orderer \"orderer\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 0.0.0.0:7050- 7050/tcp orderer.blockchain.com fd5092d61ba8 hyperledger/fabric-ca \"sh -c 'fabric-ca-se\u2026\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 0.0.0.0:8054- 7054/tcp ca_Org1 bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ Section 5 - Create a channel in the Hyperledger Fabric network In a Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.0 network, multiple channels can be created. Each channel can have its own policies for things such as requirements for endorsement and what organizations may join the channel. This allows for a subset of network participants to participate in their own channel. Imagine a scenario where OrgA, OrgB and OrgC are three organizations participating in the network. You could set up a channel in which all three organizations participate. You could also set up a channel where only OrgA and OrgB participate. In this case, the peers in OrgC would not see the transactions occurring in that channel. OrgA could participate in another channel with only OrgC, in which case OrgB does not have visibility. And so on. You could create channels with the same participants, but have different policies. For example, perhaps one channel with OrgA, OrgB, and OrgC could require all three organizations to endorse a transaction proposal, but another channel with OrgA, OrgB and OrgC could require just two, or even just one, of the three organizations to endorse a transaction proposal. Note: A use case where only one organization would need to endorse a transaction proposal would be unusual, as the whole point of blockchain is for multiple organizations to agree on what is valid transaction, and allowing just one organization to consider a transaction valid sort of goes against the grain of that type of thinking, but I never say never (oops! I just said it twice) but it is technically possible. Most trust models would probably call for a majority, a super-majority (e.g. two-thirds), or even unanimous consent (100%) of the organizations in the channel to endorse a transaction proposal. Note: A policy of requiring unanimous consent implies that each member organization should build an available and resilient infrastructure since if even one organization's peers are unavailable, then additions to the blockchain for that channel would grind to a halt. Then again, who runs in production without an available and resilient infrastructure anyway? The decision on how many channels to create and what policies they have will usually be driven by the requirements of the particular business problem being solved. Step 5.1: Access the cli Docker container: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ docker exec --interactive --tty cli bash root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer#ic/peer# Observe that your command prompt changes when you enter the Docker container's shell. The docker exec command runs a command against an existing Docker container. The --interactive and --tty arguments basically work together to say, \"we want an interactive terminal session with this Docker container\". cli is the name of the Docker container (this came from the container_name statement in the docker-compose.yaml file for the cli service). bash is the name of the command you want to enter. In other words, you are entering a Bash shell within the cli Docker container. For most of the rest of the lab, you will be entering commands within this Bash shell. Instead of working as user bcuser on the ubuntu16045 server in the ~/zmarbles directory, you are now inside the Docker container with ID acd1f96d8807 (your ID will differ), working in the /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer directory. It is no coincidence that that directory is the value of the working_dir statement for the cli service in your docker-compose.yaml file. Step 5.2: Read on to learn about a convenience script to point to a particular peer from the cli Docker container. Within the cli container, a convenience script named setpeer is provided in the scripts subdirectory of your current working directory. This script will set the environment variables to the values necessary to point to a particular peer. The script takes two arguments. The first argument is either 0 or 1 for Organization 0 or Organization 1 respectively, and the second argument is for either Peer 0 or Peer 1 of the organization selected by the first argument. Therefore, throughout the remainder of this lab, before sending commands to a peer, you will enter one of the following four valid combinations from within the cli Docker container, depending on which peer you want to run the command on: source scripts/setpeer 0 0 # to target Org 0, peer 0 (peer0.unitedmarbles.com) source scripts/setpeer 0 1 # to target Org 0, peer 1 (peer1.united marbles.com) source scripts/setpeer 1 0 # to target Org 1, peer 0 (peer0.marblesinc.com) source scripts/setpeer 1 1 # to target Org 1, peer 1 (peer1.marblesinc.com) Step 5.3: Choose your favorite peer and use one of the four source scripts/setpeer commands listed in the prior step. Although you are going to join all four peers to our channel, you only need to issue the channel creation command once. You can issue it from any of the four peers, so pick your favorite peer and issue the source command. In this screen snippet, I have chosen Org 1, peer 1. Issue the command below, leaving the arguments '1 1' as is, or change it to one of the other valid combinations as described in the previous step: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# source scripts/setpeer 1 1 CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/marblesinc.com/peers/peer1.marblesinc.com/tls/ca.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.key CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/marblesinc.com/users/Admin@marblesinc.com/msp CORE_PEER_ID=cli CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1.marblesinc.com:7051 root@fbe81505b8a2:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# The last environment variable listed, CORE_PEER_ADDRESS , determines to which peer your commands will be routed. Step 5.4: The Hyperledger Fabric network is configured to require TLS, so when you enter your peer commands, you need to add a flag that indicates TLS is enabled, and you need to add an argument that points to the root signer certificate of the certificate authority for the orderer service. Fortunately, an environment variable has been set for you within the CLI container that sets the flag ( --tls argument) and points to the appropriate certificate (the --cafile argument) so that you can simply pass both arguments by specifying the single short environment variable name instead of having to enter the two arguments and the tediously long argument value for --cafile . Enter this command now to see the value of this environment variable, and thank me later for setting this up for you: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# echo $FABRIC_TLS --tls --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/blockchain.com/orderers/orderer.blockchain.com/msp/cacerts/ca.blockchain.com-cert.pem Step 5.5: Now enter this command: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer channel create -o orderer.blockchain.com:7050 -f channel-artifacts/channel.tx $FABRIC_TLS -c $CHANNEL_NAME 2018-10-22 18:54:06.576 UTC [channelCmd] InitCmdFactory - INFO 001 Endorser and orderer connections initialized 2018-10-22 18:54:06.608 UTC [cli.common] readBlock - INFO 002 Received block: 0 The last line before you get your command prompt back will contain the words \"Received block: 0\". This indicates that your channel creation was successful, and the peer received the initial, or genesis block for the channel, which is block 0. Programmers love to start counting things at zero instead of one- it makes them feel special. Proceed to the next section where you will join each peer to the channel. \u2003 Section 6 - Instruct each peer node to join the channel In the last section, you issued the peer channel create command from one of the peers. Now any peer that you want to join the channel may join- you will issue the peer channel join command from each peer. For a peer to be eligible to join a channel, it must be a member of an organization that is authorized to join the channel. When you created your channel, you authorized Org0MSP and Org1MSP to join the channel. Each of your four peers belongs to one of those two organizations- two peers for each one- so they will be able to join successfully. If someone from an organization other than Org0MSP or Org1MSP attempted to join their peers to this channel, the attempt would fail. You are going to repeat the following steps for each of the four peer nodes, in order to show that the peer successfully joined the channel: Use the scripts/setpeer script to point the CLI to the peer Use the peer channel list command to show that the peer is not joined to any channels Use the peer channel join command to join the peer to your channel Use the peer channel list command again to see that the peer has joined your channel Step 6.1: Point the cli to peer0 for Org0MSP : root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# source scripts/setpeer 0 0 CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/ca.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.key CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org0MSP CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/users/Admin@unitedmarbles.com/msp CORE_PEER_ID=cli CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.unitedmarbles.com:7051 Step 6.2: Enter peer channel list and observe that no channels are returned at the end of the output: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer channel list 2018-10-22 18:56:48.488 UTC [channelCmd] InitCmdFactory - INFO 001 Endorser and orderer connections initialized Channels peers has joined: Step 6.3: Issue peer channel join -b $CHANNEL_NAME.block to join the channel you set up when you ran generateArtifacts.sh a little while ago.

Not all peers for an organization need to be defined as anchor peers. Peers from other organizations will reach out to anchor peers which can then make information about the other peers available. In a production environment, an organization will typically define more than one peer as an anchor peer for availability and resilience. In our lab, we will just define one of the two peers for each organization as an anchor peer. The definition of an anchor peer took place back in section 4 when you ran the generateArtifacts.sh script. Two of the output files from that step were Org0MSPanchors.tx and Org1MSPanchors.tx. These are input files to define the anchor peers for Org0MSP and Org1MSP respectively. After the channel is created, each organization needs to run this command. You will do that now- this process is a little bit confusing in that the command to do this starts with peer channel create ... but the command will actually update the existing channel with the information about the desired anchor peer. Think of peer channel create here as meaning, \"create an update transaction for a channel\".

This is because this operation does not cause the peer to communicate with the orderer. Also, you did not need to specify the $CHANNEL_NAME environment variable. This is because the peer chaincode install command only installs the chaincode on the peer node. You only need to do this once per peer. That is, even if you wanted to invoke the same chaincode on multiple channels on a peer, you only install the chaincode once on that peer. Installing chaincode on a peer is a necessary step, but not the only step needed, in order to execute chaincode on that peer. The chaincode must also be instantiated on a channel that the peer participates in. You will do that in the next section. \u2003 Section 9 - Instantiate the chaincode on the channel In the previous section, you installed chaincode on two of your four peers. Chaincode installation is a peer-level operation. Chaincode instantiation, however, is a channel-level operation. It only needs to be performed once on the channel, no matter how many peers have joined the channel. I'll try to prove it to you in this section. Chaincode instantiation causes a transaction to occur on the channel, so even if a peer on the channel does not have the chaincode installed, it will be made aware of the instantiate transaction, and thus be aware that the chaincode exists and be able to commit transactions from the chaincode to the ledger- it just would not be able to endorse a transaction on the chaincode. Step 9.1: You want to stay signed in to the cli Docker container; however, you will also want to issue some Docker commands from your Linux on IBM Z host, so at this time open up a second terminal session and sign in to your Linux on IBM Z host. For the remainder of this lab, I will refer to the session where you are in the cli Docker container as Terminal Session 1 , and this new session where you are at the Linux on IBM Z host as Terminal Session 2 . If you are running this lab from a Windows laptop you probably are using PuTTY. If you are running this lab from Linux or MacOS you are probably using terminal sessions and using ssh . Step 9.2: You are going to confirm that you do not have any chaincode Docker images created, nor any Docker chaincode containers running currently. From Terminal Session 2, enter this command and observe that all of your images begin with hyperledger : bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE hyperledger/fabric-tools 1.4.0 4032f6069cf9 2 months ago 1.52GB hyperledger/fabric-orderer 1.4.0 a8875e4d43b3 2 months ago 147MB hyperledger/fabric-peer 1.4.0 598805b785db 2 months ago 153MB hyperledger/fabric-ca 1.4.0 c44392389f74 2 months ago 216MB hyperledger/fabric-couchdb s390x-0.4.14 7afa6ce179e6 5 months ago 1.55GB You should not have any images which begin with dev- , which is what your Docker chaincode images will start with, and at this point in the lab Docker chaincode images have not been created yet. Step 9.3: Now do essentially the same thing with docker ps and you should see all of the Docker containers for the Hyperledger Fabric processes and CouchDB, but no chaincode-related Docker containers: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker ps --all CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES f78c6f5f3c26 hyperledger/fabric-tools \"bash\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes cli f4cf393f4551 hyperledger/fabric-peer \"peer node start\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 0.0.0.0:10051- 7051/tcp, 0.0.0.0:10052- 7052/tcp, 0.0.0.0:10053- 7053/tcp peer1.marblesinc.com 4a476224ddd1 hyperledger/fabric-peer \"peer node start\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 0.0.0.0:8051- 7051/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8052- 7052/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8053- 7053/tcp peer1.unitedmarbles.com 37df79435787 hyperledger/fabric-peer \"peer node start\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 0.0.0.0:7051-7053- 7051-7053/tcp peer0.unitedmarbles.com 502c9dd2fa11 hyperledger/fabric-peer \"peer node start\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 0.0.0.0:9051- 7051/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9052- 7052/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9053- 7053/tcp peer0.marblesinc.com 6bb22da9c588 hyperledger/fabric-ca \"sh -c 'fabric-ca-se\u2026\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 0.0.0.0:7054- 7054/tcp ca_Org0 e362dce38155 hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:s390x-0.4.13 \"tini -- /docker-ent\u2026\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:6984- 5984/tcp couchdb1 f15be8759be9 hyperledger/fabric-orderer \"orderer\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 0.0.0.0:7050- 7050/tcp orderer.blockchain.com 7f06745d71f1 hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:s390x-0.4.13 \"tini -- /docker-ent\u2026\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5984- 5984/tcp couchdb0 a1bc90cd0186 hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:s390x-0.4.13 \"tini -- /docker-ent\u2026\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8984- 5984/tcp couchdb3 5c91c2280a86 hyperledger/fabric-ca \"sh -c 'fabric-ca-se\u2026\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 0.0.0.0:8054- 7054/tcp ca_Org1 3a4944e8c58b hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:s390x-0.4.13 \"tini -- /docker-ent\u2026\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:7984- 5984/tcp couchdb2 Step 9.4: Entering this will make this fact stand out more as you should only see column headers in your output. (The --invert-match argument for grep says \"do not show me anything that contains the string \"hyperledger\"): bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker ps --all | grep --invert-match hyperledger CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES Now that you have established that you have no chaincode-related Docker images or containers present, try to instantiate the chaincode. Step 9.5: On Terminal Session 1, switch to Peer 0 of Org0MSP by entering: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# source scripts/setpeer 0 0 CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/ca.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.key CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org0MSP CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/users/Admin@unitedmarbles.com/msp CORE_PEER_ID=cli CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.unitedmarbles.com:7051 Step 9.6: On Terminal Session 1, enter this command to list instantiated chaincodes on your channel. Spoiler alert- there aren't any, so you will get an empty list: root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode list --instantiated --channelID ${CHANNEL_NAME} Get instantiated chaincodes on channel mychannel: root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# Step 9.7: On Terminal Session 1, issue the command to instantiate the chaincode on the channel: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode instantiate -o orderer.blockchain.com:7050 -n marbles -v 1.0 -c '{\"Args\":[\"init\",\"1\"]}' -P \"OR ('Org0MSP.member','Org1MSP.member')\" $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME 2018-10-22 19:16:30.024 UTC [chaincodeCmd] checkChaincodeCmdParams - INFO 001 Using default escc 2018-10-22 19:16:30.024 UTC [chaincodeCmd] checkChaincodeCmdParams - INFO 002 Using default vscc Note: In your prior commands, when specifying the channel name, you used lowercase 'c' as the argument, e.g., -c $CHANNEL_NAME . In the peer chaincode instantiate command however, you use an uppercase 'C' as the argument to specify the channel name, e.g., -C mychannel , because -c is used to specify the arguments given to the chaincode. Why c for arguments you may ask? Well, the ' c ' is short for ' ctor ', which itself is an abbreviation for constructor , which is a fancy word object-oriented programmers use to refer to the initial arguments given when creating an object. Step 9.8: You may have noticed a longer than usual pause before you got your command prompt back while that last command was being run. The reason for this is that as part of the instantiate, a Docker image for the chaincode is created and then a Docker container is started from the image. To prove this to yourself, on Terminal Session 2, enter this to see the new Docker image: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker images dev-* REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0-7e92f069adb7469939a96dcba723fa2019745461f05a562e81cec38e46424aa1 latest 9f1fc6820d01 5 seconds ago 137MB Step 9.9: And enter this to see the Docker chaincode container created from the new Docker image: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker ps | grep --invert-match hyperledger CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 054fe600d195 dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0-7e92f069adb7469939a96dcba723fa2019745461f05a562e81cec38e46424aa1 \"chaincode -peer.add\u2026\" 27 seconds ago Up 26 seconds dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0 bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ The naming convention used by Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.0 for the Docker images it creates for chaincode is HyperledgerFabricNetworkName-PeerName-ChaincodeName-ChaincodeVersion-SHA256Hash . In our case of dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0- , the default name of a Hyperledger Fabric network is dev , and you did not change it. peer0.unitedmarbles.com is the peer name of peer0 of Org0MSP, and you specified this via the CORE_PEER_ID environment variable in the Docker Compose YAML file. marbles is the name you gave this chaincode in the -n argument of the peer chaincode install command, and 1.0 is the version of the chaincode you used in the -v argument of the peer chaincode install command. Note that a chaincode Docker container was only created for the peer on which you entered the peer chaincode instantiate command. Docker containers will not be created on the other peers until you run a peer chaincode invoke or peer chaincode query command on that peer. Step 9.10: In Terminal Session 1 repeat the command from Step 9.6 to see that your instantiated chaincode on your channel is now listed: root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode list --instantiated --channelID ${CHANNEL_NAME} Get instantiated chaincodes on channel mychannel: Name: marbles, Version: 1.0, Path: github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/marbles, Escc: escc, Vscc: vscc root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# Step 9.11: Remember when I said at the beginning of this section that I would try to prove it to you that you only need to do the instantiate once on a channel, and not on every peer in the channel? Let's find out if I'm lying. You did the instantiate on peer \"0 0\". Switch to another peer: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# source scripts/setpeer 1 1 CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.key CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.crt CORE_PEER_ID=cli CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/marblesinc.com/users/Admin@marblesinc.com/msp CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/marblesinc.com/peers/peer1.marblesinc.com/tls/ca.crt CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1.marblesinc.com:7051 CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock Step 9.12: Repeat the command from Step 9.10 on this peer, and even though you did not run the peer chaincode instantiate on this peer, you will see that this peer is aware of the instantiation: root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode list --instantiated --channelID ${CHANNEL_NAME} Get instantiated chaincodes on channel mychannel: Name: marbles, Version: 1.0, Escc: escc, Vscc: vscc root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# I would never lie to you. Section 10 - Invoke chaincode functions You are now ready to invoke chaincode functions that will create, read, update and delete data in the ledger. In this section, you will enter scripts/setpeer and peer chaincode commands in Terminal session 1, while you will enter docker ps and docker images commands in Terminal session 2. Step 10.1: Switch to peer0 of Org0MSP: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# source scripts/setpeer 0 0 CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/ca.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.key CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org0MSP CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/users/Admin@unitedmarbles.com/msp CORE_PEER_ID=cli CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.unitedmarbles.com:7051 Step 10.2: You will use the marbles chaincode to create a new Marbles owner named John. If you would like to use a different name than John, that is fine but then there will be other places later where you would need to use your \"custom\" name instead of John. And John's the guy who first got this lab working about three years ago so I think he deserves a marble, don't you, so if you do want to show off and change the name then I'm going to let you figure out later where it might need to be changed. Enter this command in Terminal session 1: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"init_owner\", \"o0000000000001\",\"John\",\"Marbles Inc\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME 2018-10-22 19:24:22.227 UTC [chaincodeCmd] InitCmdFactory - INFO 001 Retrieved channel (mychannel) orderer endpoint: orderer.blockchain.com:7050 2018-10-22 19:24:22.240 UTC [chaincodeCmd] chaincodeInvokeOrQuery - INFO 002 Chaincode invoke successful. result: status:200 Step 10.3: Let's deconstruct the arguments to the chaincode: {\u201cArgs\u201d:[\u201cinit_owner\u201d, \u201co0000000000001\u201d, \u201cJohn\u201d, \u201cMarbles Inc\u201d]} This is in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a very popular format for transmitting data in many languages, not just with JavaScript. What is shown above is a single name/value pair. The name is Args and the value is an array of four arguments. (The square brackets \"[\" and \"]\" specify an array in JSON). Note: In the formal JSON definition the term ' name/value ' is used, but many programmers will also use the term ' key/value ' instead. You can consider these two terms as synonymous. (Many people use the phrase \"the same\" instead of the word \"synonymous\"). The Args name specifies the arguments passed to the chaincode invocation. There is an interface layer, also called a \"shim\", that gains control before passing it along to user-written chaincode functions- it expects this Args name/value pair. The shim also expects the first array value to be the name of the user-written chaincode function that it will pass control to, and then all remaining array values are the arguments to pass, in order, to that user-written chaincode function. So, in the command you just entered, the init_owner function is called, and it is passed three arguments, o0000000000001 , John , and Marbles Inc . It is logic within the init_owner function that cause updates to the channel's ledger- subject to the transaction flow in Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.0- that is, chaincode execution causes proposed updates to the ledger, which are only committed at the end of the transaction flow if everything is validated properly. But it all starts with function calls inside the chaincode functions that ask for ledger state to be created or updated. Step 10.4: Go to Terminal session 2, and enter this Docker command and you will observe that you still only have a Docker image and a Docker container for peer0 of Org0MSP: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker images dev-* REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0-7e92f069adb7469939a96dcba723fa2019745461f05a562e81cec38e46424aa1 latest 9f1fc6820d01 About a minute ago 137MB Step 10.5: Enter this command to see information about the chaincode container. I introduce here the --no-trunc option, which stands for no truncation , so you can see more information about the container: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker ps --no-trunc | grep dev- 054fe600d195101a4e735bd213f433b41b40d7c1496bf325425e81fa5f789955 dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0-7e92f069adb7469939a96dcba723fa2019745461f05a562e81cec38e46424aa1 \"chaincode -peer.address=peer0.unitedmarbles.com:7052\" About a minute ago Up About a minute dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0 The takeaway is that the chaincode execution has only run on peer0 of Org0MSP so far, and this is also the peer on which you instantiated the chaincode, so the Docker image for the chaincode, and the corresponding Docker container based on the image, have been created for only this peer. You will see soon that other peers will have their own chaincode Docker image and Docker container built the first time they are needed. Step 10.6: You created a marble owner in the previous step. Now create a marble belonging to this owner. Perform this from peer0 of Org1, so from Terminal session 1, switch to Peer0 of Org1MSP: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# source scripts/setpeer 1 0 CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/marblesinc.com/peers/peer0.marblesinc.com/tls/ca.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.key CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/marblesinc.com/users/Admin@marblesinc.com/msp CORE_PEER_ID=cli CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.marblesinc.com:7051 Step 10.7: Now enter the command to create a new marble for John: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"init_marble\",\"m0000000000001\",\"blue\",\"35\",\"o0000000000001\",\"Marbles Inc\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME 2018-10-22 19:28:54.043 UTC [chaincodeCmd] InitCmdFactory - INFO 001 Retrieved channel (mychannel) orderer endpoint: orderer.blockchain.com:7050 2018-10-22 19:29:08.962 UTC [chaincodeCmd] chaincodeInvokeOrQuery - INFO 002 Chaincode invoke successful. result: status:200 This time you called the init_marble function. Now you have created one owner, and one marble. The owner is John (or your custom name) and his id is o0000000000001 , and his marble has an id of m0000000000001 .

You have had enough experience switching between peers with source scripts/setpeer and issuing the peer chaincode invoke command that I will not show the output, nor tell you from which peer you should enter your command. I will just list several more commands you can run against the marbles chaincode. Feel free to switch amongst the four peers as you see fit before you enter each command. Note however, that you have only installed the chaincode on three of the four peers, so if you choose that fourth peer, you will need to install the chaincode there first. I won't tell you which peer does not currently have the chaincode installed, but if you need a hint, it is the one that does not have a Docker image built yet for its chaincode. (Note that checking for the absence of a Docker image for a peer is not, by itself,proof that you have not installed the chaincode on that peer- the Docker image is not built until you first invoke a function against the chaincode on that peer). If you are ambitious and want to install the chaincode on that fourth peer, try the useful Docker commands I have shown you from PuTTY session 2 to see that the chaincode's Docker image and Docker container are created when you invoke a transaction on that fourth peer. Try some or all of these commands from Terminal session 1: Create a marble for Barry, i.e., owner o0000000000002: peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"init_marble\",\"m0000000000002\",\"green\",\"50\",\"o0000000000002\",\"United Marbles\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME Obtain all marble information- marbles and owners: peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"read_everything\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME Change marble ownership- 'Barry' is giving his marble to 'John': peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"set_owner\",\"m0000000000002\",\"o0000000000001\",\"United Marbles\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME Get the history of marble 'm0000000000002': peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"getHistory\",\"m0000000000002\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME Delete marble 'm0000000000002': peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"delete_marble\",\"m0000000000002\",\"Marbles Inc\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME Try again to get the history of marble 'm0000000000002' after you just deleted it: peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"getHistory\",\"m0000000000002\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME Obtain all marble information again.

Stay logged in to your two terminal sessions and leave your Hyperledger Fabric network and all the chaincode Docker containers up and running- you will use what you created here in Part 2 of the lab where you will install a front-end application offering a browser-based UI from which you will interact with the marbles chaincode that you have installed in here in Part 1.","title":"Part 1"},{"location":"hlf-part1/#section-1-overview-of-hyperledger-fabric-smart-contract-installation-lab-part-1","text":"In this lab, you will work with the Marbles demo application, which is considered by many to be a de facto \"hello world\" application for getting started with Hyperledger Fabric. Hyperledger Fabric is one of several projects within the open-source Hyperledger collaborative effort hosted by the Linux Foundation. Hyperledger Fabric provides the distributed ledger, a.k.a. blockchain, technology that is the core of IBM Blockchain solutions and services. Below is a diagram that depicts the blockchain network you will build and operate: You will use Docker Compose to bring up a Hyperledger Fabric network in which two organizations will participate. There will be one orderer service for the entire network, and each organization will use its own certificate authority service and have two peer nodes. Each peer node will use CouchDB for its ledger store. Each peer node's CouchDB will run in a separate Docker container. That makes eleven Docker containers, as follows: 1 orderer service Docker container 2 certificate authority (CA) Docker containers (one for each organization) 4 peer node Docker containers (each of the two organizations has two peers) 4 CouchDB Docker containers (each peer node has its own separate CouchDB ledger store) You will also bring up a twelfth Docker container that we will call the cli container. You will use it as a convenience to enter Hyperledger Fabric commands targeted to specific peers. You will see how this is done later in the lab. The network you bring up will use Transport Layer Security (TLS) which provides secure, encrypted communications between the peer nodes and the orderer, just as most production implementations will require. You will install the Marbles chaincode on the peer nodes, instantiate the chaincode, and invoke functions of the chaincode. I will explain later in the lab the difference between the install and instantiate actions and what each one does.","title":"Section 1 - Overview of Hyperledger Fabric Smart Contract installation lab part 1"},{"location":"hlf-part1/#section-2-description-of-the-subsequent-sections-in-part-1","text":"This section provides a brief description of the subsequent sections in Part 1 of the lab, where you will get hands-on experience with the Hyperledger Fabric command line interface (CLI). In most production implementations you would perform many of these functions through other means, such as programmatically through an Application Programming Interface (API) provided by a Hyperledger Fabric Software Development Kit (SDK), which the project provides for the Node.js, Java, Golang and Python programming languages, or perhaps through a user interface such as the one provided by the IBM Blockchain Platform. But using the CLI, as you will in this lab, is a great way to learn about how Hyperledger Fabric works. You will extract the artifacts necessary to run the lab in Section 3. All the artifacts necessary for the lab are provided in a compressed tarball- in essence, a zip file. You will use Docker Compose in Section 4 to bring up the twelve Docker containers that comprise the Hyperledger Fabric network. You will see that all twelve Docker containers that I mentioned in Section 1 are brought up with a single docker-compose command, and I will explain some of the more interesting bits of what is going on under the covers. You will create a channel in the Hyperledger Fabric network in Section 5. In Hyperledger Fabric, each channel is essentially its own blockchain. You will instruct each peer node to join the channel in Section 6. We will join all four Peer nodes to the channel. Peer nodes can be members of more than one channel, but for this lab you are only creating one channel. You will define an \"anchor\" peer for each organization in the channel in Section 7. An anchor peer for an organization is a peer that is known by all the other organizations in a channel. Not all peers for an organization need to be known by outside organizations. Peers not defined as anchor peers are visible only within their own organization. You will install the chaincode on the peer nodes in Section 8. Installing chaincode simply puts the chaincode executable on the file system of the peer. It is a necessary step before you execute that chaincode on the peer, but the next step is also required. You will instantiate the chaincode on the channel in Section 9. This step is a prerequisite to being able to run chaincode on a channel. It only needs to be performed on one peer that is a member of the channel. This causes a transaction to be recorded on the channel's blockchain to indicate that the chaincode can be run on the channel. You will invoke functions on the chaincode that will create, read, update and delete (CRUD) data stored on the blockchain in Section 10. Blocks of transactions in a blockchain are always added (i.e., created), and they can be read, but they are never, in normal operations, updated or deleted. However, although the blocks in a chain are not updated or deleted, the transactions themselves operate on Key/Value pairs that can have all CRUD operations performed on them. This collection of Key/Value pairs is often referred to as state data.","title":"Section 2 - Description of the subsequent sections in Part 1"},{"location":"hlf-part1/#section-3-extract-the-artifacts-necessary-to-run-the-lab","text":"Log in to your assigned Linux on Z Ubuntu instance with the instructions provided to you by your class instructor. If you are using Linux or MacOS you will likely be using ssh to log in via a Terminal window. If you are using Windows, you will most likely be using a PuTTY terminal session. If you are trying this lab at home, I am assuming you can figure out how to log in. All of the following instructions in the lab assume that you have successfully logged in to the Linux on Z Ubuntu instance assigned to your team. As you proceed through the lab, you will have to be logged in to more than one terminal session. When that becomes necessary, simply follow the same procedure used to log in to your first terminal session. Let's get started! Step 3.1: Navigate to the home directory by entering cd ~ (the \"tilde\" character, i.e., ' ~ ', represents the user's home directory in Linux). This directory is also usually set in the $HOME environment variable, so cd $HOME will also usually get you to your home directory: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ cd ~ bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ Note: You may already be in your home directory prior to entering cd ~ , in which case you'll just stay there- not a problem.

The configtxgen utility generates input to channel configuration transaction inputs, and it is expecting the channel-artifacts directory to exist.

The docker-compose-template.yaml file is used as a template file that the generateArtifacts.sh script will use to create the main Docker Compose template file, docker-compose.yaml , which contains definitions for all of the Docker containers that you will need. The examples directory contains the actual Marbles chaincode within its subdirectory structure. The generateArtifacts.sh script is used to generate channel configuration transaction input and to generate cryptographic material and it also creates docker-compose.yaml , using docker-compose-template.yaml as input.

So, if you see me place comments after any commands you do not have to enter them but if you do, it will not hurt anything. This script calls two Hyperledger Fabric utilites- cryptogen , which creates security material (certificates and keys) and configtxgen (Configuration Transaction Generator), which is called four times, to create four things: An orderer genesis block -- this will be the first block on the orderer's system channel. The location of this block is specified to the Orderer when it is started up via the ORDERER_GENERAL_GENESISFILE environment variable. A channel transaction -- later in the lab, this is sent to the orderer and will cause a new channel to be created when you run the peer channel create command. An anchor peer update for Org0MSP. An anchor peer is a peer that is set up so that peers from other organizations may communicate with it. The concept of anchor peers allows an organization to create multiple peers, perhaps to provide extra capacity or throughput or resilience (or all the above) but not have to advertise this to outside organizations. An anchor peer update for Org1MSP. You will perform the anchor peer updates for both Org0MSP and Org1MSP later in the lab via peer channel create commands. Step 4.3: Issue the following command which will show you all files that were created by the configtxgen utility when it was called from inside generateArtifacts.sh : bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ ls -ltr channel-artifacts total 28 -rw-r--r-- 1 bcuser bcuser 12787 Oct 22 14:08 genesis.block -rw-r--r-- 1 bcuser bcuser 346 Oct 22 14:08 channel.tx -rw-r--r-- 1 bcuser bcuser 285 Oct 22 14:08 Org0MSPanchors.tx -rw-r--r-- 1 bcuser bcuser 282 Oct 22 14:08 Org1MSPanchors.tx genesis.block will be passed to the orderer at startup, and will be used to configure the orderer's system channel . This file contains the x.509 signing certificates for every organization defined within the consortia that were specified within the configtx.yaml file when configtxgen was run. The system channel contains other values such as parameters defining when a block of transactions is cut- e.g., based on time, number of transactions, or block size- and these values serve as a template, that is, as defaults, for any additional channels that might be created, if a new channel creation request does not provide its own custom values. channel.tx is the input for a configuration transaction that will create a channel. You will use this as input to a peer channel create request in Section 5 . Org0MSPanchors.tx and Org1MSPanchors.tx are inputs for configuration transactions that will define an anchor peer for Org0 and Org1 respectively. You will use these inputs in Section 7 . Step 4.4: Issue the following command which will show you all files that were created by the cryptogen utility when it was called from inside generateArtifacts.sh . This command will show one screen at a time and pause- press the Enter key to scroll to the end, that is, until you get your command prompt back: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ ls -ltrR crypto-config | more . . (output not shown here) . Actually, these files were created before the files listed in the prior step, Step 4.3 , were created, because, among the many cryptographic artifacts created are the x.509 signing certificates for the organizations, which are baked into the genesis.block discussed in the prior step. You can see that there is a dizzying set of directories and files, containing things like CA root certificates, signing certificates, TLS certificates, corresponding private keys, and public keys, for certificate authorities, organizations, administrative and general users. A thorough discussion of them is beyond the scope of this lab. Note: This utiltity created crypto material for both organizations, including private keys that each organization would keep secret and never share with the other organizations. You have created this for both organizations on a single server for purposes of this lab, but in a production implementation each organization would create their own material separately so that they could indeed keep their private keys to themselves. Their public certificates, which are meant to be shared, are baked into the channel definitions for channels in which they participate. This allows peer nodes from all organizations in a channel to verify digital signatures of transaction requests and transaction endorsements from other organizations that are members of the channel. Step 4.5: You are going to look inside the Docker Compose configuration file a little bit. Enter the following command: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ vi -R docker-compose.yaml You can enter Ctrl-f to scroll forward in the file and Ctrl-b to scroll back in the file. The -R flag opens the file in read-only mode, so if you accidentally change something in the file, it's okay. It will not be saved. The statements within docker-compose.yaml are in a markup language called YAML , which stands for Y et A nother M arkup L anguage. (Who says nerds do not have a sense of humor). We will go over some highlights here. There are twelve \"services\", or Docker containers, defined within this file. They all start in column 3 and have several statements to describe them. For example, the first service defined is ca0 , and there are image , environment , ports , command , volumes , and container_name statements that describe it. If you scroll down in the file with Ctrl-f you will see all the services. Not every service has the same statements describing it. The twelve services are: ca0 -- The certificate authority service for \"Organization 0\" (unitedmarbles.com) ca1 -- The certificate authority service for \"Organization 1\" (marblesinc.com) orderer.blockchain.com -- The single ordering service that both organizations will use peer0.unitedmarbles.com -- The first peer node for \"Organization 0\" peer1.unitedmarbles.com -- The second peer node for \"Organization 0\" peer0.marblesinc.com -- The first peer node for \"Organization 1\" peer1.marblesinc.com -- The second peer node for \"Organization 1\" couchdb0 -- The CouchDB server for peer0.unitedmarbles.com couchdb1 -- The CouchDB server for peer1.unitedmarbles.com couchdb2 -- The CouchDB server for peer0.marblesinc.com couchdb3 -- The CouchDB server for peer1.marblesinc.com cli -- The Docker container from which you will enter Hyperledger Fabric command line interface (CLI) commands targeted towards a peer node. I will describe how several statements work within the file, but time does not permit me to address every single line in the file! image statements define which Docker image file the Docker container will be created from. Basically, the Docker image file is a static file that, once created, is read-only. A Docker container is based on a Docker image, and any changes to the file system within a Docker container are stored within the container. So, multiple Docker containers can be based on the same Docker image, and each Docker container keeps track of its own changes. For example, the containers built for the ca0 and ca1 service will both be based on the hyperledger/fabric-ca:1.4.0 Docker image because they both have this statement in their definition: image: hyperledger/fabric-ca:1.4.0 environment statements define environment variables that are available to the Docker container. The Hyperledger Fabric processes make ample use of environment variables. In general, you will see that the certificate authority environment variables start with FABRIC_CA , the orderer's environment variables start with ORDERER_GENERAL , and the peer node's environment variables start with CORE . These variables control behavior of the Hyperledger Fabric code, and in many cases, will override values that are specified in configuration files. Notice that all the peers and the orderer have an environment variable to specify that TLS is enabled- CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true for the peers and ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_ENABLED=true for the orderer. You will notice there are other TLS-related variables to specify private keys, certificates and root certificates. ports statements map ports on our Linux on IBM Z host to ports within the Docker container. The syntax is host port : Docker container port . For example, the service for ca1 has this port statement: ports: - \"8054:7054\" This says that port 7054 in the Docker container for the ca1 node will be mapped to port 8054 on your Linux on IBM Z host. This is how you can run two CA nodes in two Docker containers and four peer nodes in four Docker containers and keep things straight- within each CA node they are both using port 7054, and within each peer node Docker container, they are all using port 7051 for the same thing, but if you want to get to one of the peers from your host or even the outside world, you would target the appropriate host-mapped port. Note: To see the port mappings for the peers you have to look in base/docker-compose.yaml . See if you can figure out why. container_name statements are used to create hostnames that the Docker containers spun up by the docker-compose command use to communicate with each other. A separate, private network will be created by Docker where the 12 Docker containers can communicate with each other via the names specified by container_name . So, they do not need to worry about the port mappings from the ports statements- those are used for trying to get to the Docker containers from outside the private network created by Docker. volumes statements are used to map file systems on the host to file systems within the Docker container. Just like with ports, the file system on the host system is on the left and the file system name mapped within the Docker container is on the right. For example, look at this statement from the ca0 service: volumes: - ./crypto-config/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/ca/:/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config The security-related files that were created from the previous step where you ran generateArtifacts.sh were all within the crypto-config directory on your Linux on IBM Z host. The prior volumes statement is how this stuff is made accessible to the ca1 service that will run within the Docker container. Similar magic is done for the other services as well, except for the CouchDB services. extends statements are used by the peer nodes. What this does is merge in other statements from another file. For example, you may notice that the peer nodes do not contain an images statement. How does Docker know what Docker image file to base the container on? That is defined in the file, base/peer-base.yaml , specified in the extends section of base/docker-compose.yaml , which is specified in the extends section of docker-compose.yaml for the peer nodes. command statements define what command is run when the Docker container is started. This is how the actual Hyperledger Fabric processes get started. You can define default commands when you create the Docker image. This is why you do not see command statements for the cli service or for the CouchDB services. For the peer nodes, the command statement is specified in the base/peer-base.yaml file. working_dir statements define what directory the Docker container will be in when its startup commands are run. Again, defaults for this can be defined when the Docker image is created. When you are done reviewing the docker-compose.yaml file, exit the vi session by typing :q! (that's \"colon\", \"q\", \"exclamation point\") which will exit the file and discard any changes you may have accidentally made while browsing through the file. If :q! doesn't work right away, you may have to hit the escape key first before trying it. If that still doesn't work, ask an instructor for help- vi can be tricky if you are not used to it. If you would like to see what is in the base/docker-compose-base.yaml and base/peer-base.yaml files I mentioned, take a quick peek with vi -R base/docker-compose-base.yaml and vi -R base/peer-base.yaml and exit with the :q! key sequence when you have had enough. Step 4.6: Start the Hyperledger Fabric network by entering the command shown below: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ docker-compose up --detach Creating network \"zmarbles_default\" with the default driver Creating couchdb0 ... Creating couchdb1 ... Creating orderer.blockchain.com ... Creating couchdb0 Creating couchdb1 Creating orderer.blockchain.com Creating couchdb2 ... Creating ca_Org0 ...

Creating cli ... done Note: Depending upon the circumstances under which you run this lab, the Hyperledger Fabric Docker images required may be pulled down from the public Docker image repository, in which case you will observe messages, not shown above, that show the progress of the necessary downloads. Step 4.7: Verify that all twelve services are Up and none of them say Exited . The Exited status means something went wrong, and you should check with an instructor for help if you see any of them in Exited status. If, however, all twelve of your Docker containers are in Up status, as in the output below, you are ready to proceed to the next section: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ docker ps --all CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 91819c57c22c hyperledger/fabric-tools \"bash\" 59 seconds ago Up 58 seconds cli b62ea5779b10 hyperledger/fabric-peer \"peer node start\" About a minute ago Up 59 seconds 0.0.0.0:8051- 7051/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8052- 7052/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8053- 7053/tcp peer1.unitedmarbles.com d35dbd158520 hyperledger/fabric-peer \"peer node start\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 0.0.0.0:7051-7053- 7051-7053/tcp peer0.unitedmarbles.com f4421a4ec662 hyperledger/fabric-peer \"peer node start\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 0.0.0.0:10051- 7051/tcp, 0.0.0.0:10052- 7052/tcp, 0.0.0.0:10053- 7053/tcp peer1.marblesinc.com 0f3ab02c8ca9 hyperledger/fabric-peer \"peer node start\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 0.0.0.0:9051- 7051/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9052- 7052/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9053- 7053/tcp peer0.marblesinc.com 974005b9fdcf hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:s390x-0.4.14 \"tini -- /docker-ent\u2026\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:6984- 5984/tcp couchdb1 9eb2369169b1 hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:s390x-0.4.14 \"tini -- /docker-ent\u2026\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5984- 5984/tcp couchdb0 1c99d4adb8d3 hyperledger/fabric-ca \"sh -c 'fabric-ca-se\u2026\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 0.0.0.0:7054- 7054/tcp ca_Org0 e33ac4f4a133 hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:s390x-0.4.14 \"tini -- /docker-ent\u2026\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8984- 5984/tcp couchdb3 8adc89681b53 hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:s390x-0.4.14 \"tini -- /docker-ent\u2026\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:7984- 5984/tcp couchdb2 6d32410a76aa hyperledger/fabric-orderer \"orderer\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 0.0.0.0:7050- 7050/tcp orderer.blockchain.com fd5092d61ba8 hyperledger/fabric-ca \"sh -c 'fabric-ca-se\u2026\" About a minute ago Up About a minute 0.0.0.0:8054- 7054/tcp ca_Org1 bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$","title":"Section 4 - Bring up the twelve Docker containers that comprise the Hyperledger Fabric network"},{"location":"hlf-part1/#section-5-create-a-channel-in-the-hyperledger-fabric-network","text":"In a Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.0 network, multiple channels can be created. Each channel can have its own policies for things such as requirements for endorsement and what organizations may join the channel. This allows for a subset of network participants to participate in their own channel. Imagine a scenario where OrgA, OrgB and OrgC are three organizations participating in the network. You could set up a channel in which all three organizations participate. You could also set up a channel where only OrgA and OrgB participate. In this case, the peers in OrgC would not see the transactions occurring in that channel. OrgA could participate in another channel with only OrgC, in which case OrgB does not have visibility. And so on. You could create channels with the same participants, but have different policies. For example, perhaps one channel with OrgA, OrgB, and OrgC could require all three organizations to endorse a transaction proposal, but another channel with OrgA, OrgB and OrgC could require just two, or even just one, of the three organizations to endorse a transaction proposal. Note: A use case where only one organization would need to endorse a transaction proposal would be unusual, as the whole point of blockchain is for multiple organizations to agree on what is valid transaction, and allowing just one organization to consider a transaction valid sort of goes against the grain of that type of thinking, but I never say never (oops! I just said it twice) but it is technically possible. Most trust models would probably call for a majority, a super-majority (e.g. two-thirds), or even unanimous consent (100%) of the organizations in the channel to endorse a transaction proposal. Note: A policy of requiring unanimous consent implies that each member organization should build an available and resilient infrastructure since if even one organization's peers are unavailable, then additions to the blockchain for that channel would grind to a halt. Then again, who runs in production without an available and resilient infrastructure anyway? The decision on how many channels to create and what policies they have will usually be driven by the requirements of the particular business problem being solved. Step 5.1: Access the cli Docker container: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ docker exec --interactive --tty cli bash root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer#ic/peer# Observe that your command prompt changes when you enter the Docker container's shell. The docker exec command runs a command against an existing Docker container. The --interactive and --tty arguments basically work together to say, \"we want an interactive terminal session with this Docker container\". cli is the name of the Docker container (this came from the container_name statement in the docker-compose.yaml file for the cli service). bash is the name of the command you want to enter. In other words, you are entering a Bash shell within the cli Docker container. For most of the rest of the lab, you will be entering commands within this Bash shell. Instead of working as user bcuser on the ubuntu16045 server in the ~/zmarbles directory, you are now inside the Docker container with ID acd1f96d8807 (your ID will differ), working in the /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer directory. It is no coincidence that that directory is the value of the working_dir statement for the cli service in your docker-compose.yaml file. Step 5.2: Read on to learn about a convenience script to point to a particular peer from the cli Docker container. Within the cli container, a convenience script named setpeer is provided in the scripts subdirectory of your current working directory. This script will set the environment variables to the values necessary to point to a particular peer. The script takes two arguments. The first argument is either 0 or 1 for Organization 0 or Organization 1 respectively, and the second argument is for either Peer 0 or Peer 1 of the organization selected by the first argument. Therefore, throughout the remainder of this lab, before sending commands to a peer, you will enter one of the following four valid combinations from within the cli Docker container, depending on which peer you want to run the command on: source scripts/setpeer 0 0 # to target Org 0, peer 0 (peer0.unitedmarbles.com) source scripts/setpeer 0 1 # to target Org 0, peer 1 (peer1.united marbles.com) source scripts/setpeer 1 0 # to target Org 1, peer 0 (peer0.marblesinc.com) source scripts/setpeer 1 1 # to target Org 1, peer 1 (peer1.marblesinc.com) Step 5.3: Choose your favorite peer and use one of the four source scripts/setpeer commands listed in the prior step. Although you are going to join all four peers to our channel, you only need to issue the channel creation command once. You can issue it from any of the four peers, so pick your favorite peer and issue the source command. In this screen snippet, I have chosen Org 1, peer 1. Issue the command below, leaving the arguments '1 1' as is, or change it to one of the other valid combinations as described in the previous step: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# source scripts/setpeer 1 1 CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/marblesinc.com/peers/peer1.marblesinc.com/tls/ca.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.key CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/marblesinc.com/users/Admin@marblesinc.com/msp CORE_PEER_ID=cli CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1.marblesinc.com:7051 root@fbe81505b8a2:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# The last environment variable listed, CORE_PEER_ADDRESS , determines to which peer your commands will be routed. Step 5.4: The Hyperledger Fabric network is configured to require TLS, so when you enter your peer commands, you need to add a flag that indicates TLS is enabled, and you need to add an argument that points to the root signer certificate of the certificate authority for the orderer service. Fortunately, an environment variable has been set for you within the CLI container that sets the flag ( --tls argument) and points to the appropriate certificate (the --cafile argument) so that you can simply pass both arguments by specifying the single short environment variable name instead of having to enter the two arguments and the tediously long argument value for --cafile . Enter this command now to see the value of this environment variable, and thank me later for setting this up for you: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# echo $FABRIC_TLS --tls --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/blockchain.com/orderers/orderer.blockchain.com/msp/cacerts/ca.blockchain.com-cert.pem Step 5.5: Now enter this command: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer channel create -o orderer.blockchain.com:7050 -f channel-artifacts/channel.tx $FABRIC_TLS -c $CHANNEL_NAME 2018-10-22 18:54:06.576 UTC [channelCmd] InitCmdFactory - INFO 001 Endorser and orderer connections initialized 2018-10-22 18:54:06.608 UTC [cli.common] readBlock - INFO 002 Received block: 0 The last line before you get your command prompt back will contain the words \"Received block: 0\".

Each of your four peers belongs to one of those two organizations- two peers for each one- so they will be able to join successfully. If someone from an organization other than Org0MSP or Org1MSP attempted to join their peers to this channel, the attempt would fail. You are going to repeat the following steps for each of the four peer nodes, in order to show that the peer successfully joined the channel: Use the scripts/setpeer script to point the CLI to the peer Use the peer channel list command to show that the peer is not joined to any channels Use the peer channel join command to join the peer to your channel Use the peer channel list command again to see that the peer has joined your channel Step 6.1: Point the cli to peer0 for Org0MSP : root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# source scripts/setpeer 0 0 CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/ca.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.key CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org0MSP CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/users/Admin@unitedmarbles.com/msp CORE_PEER_ID=cli CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.unitedmarbles.com:7051 Step 6.2: Enter peer channel list and observe that no channels are returned at the end of the output: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer channel list 2018-10-22 18:56:48.488 UTC [channelCmd] InitCmdFactory - INFO 001 Endorser and orderer connections initialized Channels peers has joined: Step 6.3: Issue peer channel join -b $CHANNEL_NAME.block to join the channel you set up when you ran generateArtifacts.sh a little while ago.

Not all peers for an organization need to be defined as anchor peers. Peers from other organizations will reach out to anchor peers which can then make information about the other peers available. In a production environment, an organization will typically define more than one peer as an anchor peer for availability and resilience. In our lab, we will just define one of the two peers for each organization as an anchor peer. The definition of an anchor peer took place back in section 4 when you ran the generateArtifacts.sh script. Two of the output files from that step were Org0MSPanchors.tx and Org1MSPanchors.tx. These are input files to define the anchor peers for Org0MSP and Org1MSP respectively. After the channel is created, each organization needs to run this command. You will do that now- this process is a little bit confusing in that the command to do this starts with peer channel create ... but the command will actually update the existing channel with the information about the desired anchor peer.

This is because this operation does not cause the peer to communicate with the orderer. Also, you did not need to specify the $CHANNEL_NAME environment variable. This is because the peer chaincode install command only installs the chaincode on the peer node. You only need to do this once per peer. That is, even if you wanted to invoke the same chaincode on multiple channels on a peer, you only install the chaincode once on that peer. Installing chaincode on a peer is a necessary step, but not the only step needed, in order to execute chaincode on that peer. The chaincode must also be instantiated on a channel that the peer participates in.

Chaincode installation is a peer-level operation. Chaincode instantiation, however, is a channel-level operation. It only needs to be performed once on the channel, no matter how many peers have joined the channel. I'll try to prove it to you in this section. Chaincode instantiation causes a transaction to occur on the channel, so even if a peer on the channel does not have the chaincode installed, it will be made aware of the instantiate transaction, and thus be aware that the chaincode exists and be able to commit transactions from the chaincode to the ledger- it just would not be able to endorse a transaction on the chaincode.

Step 9.3: Now do essentially the same thing with docker ps and you should see all of the Docker containers for the Hyperledger Fabric processes and CouchDB, but no chaincode-related Docker containers: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker ps --all CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES f78c6f5f3c26 hyperledger/fabric-tools \"bash\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes cli f4cf393f4551 hyperledger/fabric-peer \"peer node start\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 0.0.0.0:10051- 7051/tcp, 0.0.0.0:10052- 7052/tcp, 0.0.0.0:10053- 7053/tcp peer1.marblesinc.com 4a476224ddd1 hyperledger/fabric-peer \"peer node start\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 0.0.0.0:8051- 7051/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8052- 7052/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8053- 7053/tcp peer1.unitedmarbles.com 37df79435787 hyperledger/fabric-peer \"peer node start\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 0.0.0.0:7051-7053- 7051-7053/tcp peer0.unitedmarbles.com 502c9dd2fa11 hyperledger/fabric-peer \"peer node start\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 0.0.0.0:9051- 7051/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9052- 7052/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9053- 7053/tcp peer0.marblesinc.com 6bb22da9c588 hyperledger/fabric-ca \"sh -c 'fabric-ca-se\u2026\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 0.0.0.0:7054- 7054/tcp ca_Org0 e362dce38155 hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:s390x-0.4.13 \"tini -- /docker-ent\u2026\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:6984- 5984/tcp couchdb1 f15be8759be9 hyperledger/fabric-orderer \"orderer\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 0.0.0.0:7050- 7050/tcp orderer.blockchain.com 7f06745d71f1 hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:s390x-0.4.13 \"tini -- /docker-ent\u2026\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5984- 5984/tcp couchdb0 a1bc90cd0186 hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:s390x-0.4.13 \"tini -- /docker-ent\u2026\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8984- 5984/tcp couchdb3 5c91c2280a86 hyperledger/fabric-ca \"sh -c 'fabric-ca-se\u2026\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 0.0.0.0:8054- 7054/tcp ca_Org1 3a4944e8c58b hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:s390x-0.4.13 \"tini -- /docker-ent\u2026\" 6 minutes ago Up 6 minutes 4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:7984- 5984/tcp couchdb2 Step 9.4: Entering this will make this fact stand out more as you should only see column headers in your output. (The --invert-match argument for grep says \"do not show me anything that contains the string \"hyperledger\"): bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker ps --all | grep --invert-match hyperledger CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES Now that you have established that you have no chaincode-related Docker images or containers present, try to instantiate the chaincode. Step 9.5: On Terminal Session 1, switch to Peer 0 of Org0MSP by entering: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# source scripts/setpeer 0 0 CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/ca.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.key CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org0MSP CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/users/Admin@unitedmarbles.com/msp CORE_PEER_ID=cli CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.unitedmarbles.com:7051 Step 9.6: On Terminal Session 1, enter this command to list instantiated chaincodes on your channel. Spoiler alert- there aren't any, so you will get an empty list: root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode list --instantiated --channelID ${CHANNEL_NAME} Get instantiated chaincodes on channel mychannel: root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# Step 9.7: On Terminal Session 1, issue the command to instantiate the chaincode on the channel: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode instantiate -o orderer.blockchain.com:7050 -n marbles -v 1.0 -c '{\"Args\":[\"init\",\"1\"]}' -P \"OR ('Org0MSP.member','Org1MSP.member')\" $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME 2018-10-22 19:16:30.024 UTC [chaincodeCmd] checkChaincodeCmdParams - INFO 001 Using default escc 2018-10-22 19:16:30.024 UTC [chaincodeCmd] checkChaincodeCmdParams - INFO 002 Using default vscc Note: In your prior commands, when specifying the channel name, you used lowercase 'c' as the argument, e.g., -c $CHANNEL_NAME . In the peer chaincode instantiate command however, you use an uppercase 'C' as the argument to specify the channel name, e.g., -C mychannel , because -c is used to specify the arguments given to the chaincode. Why c for arguments you may ask? Well, the ' c ' is short for ' ctor ', which itself is an abbreviation for constructor , which is a fancy word object-oriented programmers use to refer to the initial arguments given when creating an object. Step 9.8: You may have noticed a longer than usual pause before you got your command prompt back while that last command was being run. The reason for this is that as part of the instantiate, a Docker image for the chaincode is created and then a Docker container is started from the image. To prove this to yourself, on Terminal Session 2, enter this to see the new Docker image: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker images dev-* REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0-7e92f069adb7469939a96dcba723fa2019745461f05a562e81cec38e46424aa1 latest 9f1fc6820d01 5 seconds ago 137MB Step 9.9: And enter this to see the Docker chaincode container created from the new Docker image: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker ps | grep --invert-match hyperledger CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 054fe600d195 dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0-7e92f069adb7469939a96dcba723fa2019745461f05a562e81cec38e46424aa1 \"chaincode -peer.add\u2026\" 27 seconds ago Up 26 seconds dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0 bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ The naming convention used by Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.0 for the Docker images it creates for chaincode is HyperledgerFabricNetworkName-PeerName-ChaincodeName-ChaincodeVersion-SHA256Hash . In our case of dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0- , the default name of a Hyperledger Fabric network is dev , and you did not change it. peer0.unitedmarbles.com is the peer name of peer0 of Org0MSP, and you specified this via the CORE_PEER_ID environment variable in the Docker Compose YAML file. marbles is the name you gave this chaincode in the -n argument of the peer chaincode install command, and 1.0 is the version of the chaincode you used in the -v argument of the peer chaincode install command. Note that a chaincode Docker container was only created for the peer on which you entered the peer chaincode instantiate command. Docker containers will not be created on the other peers until you run a peer chaincode invoke or peer chaincode query command on that peer. Step 9.10: In Terminal Session 1 repeat the command from Step 9.6 to see that your instantiated chaincode on your channel is now listed: root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode list --instantiated --channelID ${CHANNEL_NAME} Get instantiated chaincodes on channel mychannel: Name: marbles, Version: 1.0, Path: github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/marbles, Escc: escc, Vscc: vscc root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# Step 9.11: Remember when I said at the beginning of this section that I would try to prove it to you that you only need to do the instantiate once on a channel, and not on every peer in the channel? Let's find out if I'm lying. You did the instantiate on peer \"0 0\". Switch to another peer: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# source scripts/setpeer 1 1 CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.key CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.crt CORE_PEER_ID=cli CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/marblesinc.com/users/Admin@marblesinc.com/msp CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/marblesinc.com/peers/peer1.marblesinc.com/tls/ca.crt CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer1.marblesinc.com:7051 CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock Step 9.12: Repeat the command from Step 9.10 on this peer, and even though you did not run the peer chaincode instantiate on this peer, you will see that this peer is aware of the instantiation: root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode list --instantiated --channelID ${CHANNEL_NAME} Get instantiated chaincodes on channel mychannel: Name: marbles, Version: 1.0, Escc: escc, Vscc: vscc root@a20e5320179f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# I would never lie to you.","title":"Section 9 - Instantiate the chaincode on the channel"},{"location":"hlf-part1/#section-10-invoke-chaincode-functions","text":"You are now ready to invoke chaincode functions that will create, read, update and delete data in the ledger. In this section, you will enter scripts/setpeer and peer chaincode commands in Terminal session 1, while you will enter docker ps and docker images commands in Terminal session 2. Step 10.1: Switch to peer0 of Org0MSP: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# source scripts/setpeer 0 0 CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/ca.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.key CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org0MSP CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/users/Admin@unitedmarbles.com/msp CORE_PEER_ID=cli CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.unitedmarbles.com:7051 Step 10.2: You will use the marbles chaincode to create a new Marbles owner named John. If you would like to use a different name than John, that is fine but then there will be other places later where you would need to use your \"custom\" name instead of John. And John's the guy who first got this lab working about three years ago so I think he deserves a marble, don't you, so if you do want to show off and change the name then I'm going to let you figure out later where it might need to be changed. Enter this command in Terminal session 1: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"init_owner\", \"o0000000000001\",\"John\",\"Marbles Inc\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME 2018-10-22 19:24:22.227 UTC [chaincodeCmd] InitCmdFactory - INFO 001 Retrieved channel (mychannel) orderer endpoint: orderer.blockchain.com:7050 2018-10-22 19:24:22.240 UTC [chaincodeCmd] chaincodeInvokeOrQuery - INFO 002 Chaincode invoke successful. result: status:200 Step 10.3: Let's deconstruct the arguments to the chaincode: {\u201cArgs\u201d:[\u201cinit_owner\u201d, \u201co0000000000001\u201d, \u201cJohn\u201d, \u201cMarbles Inc\u201d]} This is in JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a very popular format for transmitting data in many languages, not just with JavaScript. What is shown above is a single name/value pair. The name is Args and the value is an array of four arguments. (The square brackets \"[\" and \"]\" specify an array in JSON). Note: In the formal JSON definition the term ' name/value ' is used, but many programmers will also use the term ' key/value ' instead. You can consider these two terms as synonymous. (Many people use the phrase \"the same\" instead of the word \"synonymous\"). The Args name specifies the arguments passed to the chaincode invocation. There is an interface layer, also called a \"shim\", that gains control before passing it along to user-written chaincode functions- it expects this Args name/value pair. The shim also expects the first array value to be the name of the user-written chaincode function that it will pass control to, and then all remaining array values are the arguments to pass, in order, to that user-written chaincode function. So, in the command you just entered, the init_owner function is called, and it is passed three arguments, o0000000000001 , John , and Marbles Inc . It is logic within the init_owner function that cause updates to the channel's ledger- subject to the transaction flow in Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.0- that is, chaincode execution causes proposed updates to the ledger, which are only committed at the end of the transaction flow if everything is validated properly. But it all starts with function calls inside the chaincode functions that ask for ledger state to be created or updated. Step 10.4: Go to Terminal session 2, and enter this Docker command and you will observe that you still only have a Docker image and a Docker container for peer0 of Org0MSP: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker images dev-* REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0-7e92f069adb7469939a96dcba723fa2019745461f05a562e81cec38e46424aa1 latest 9f1fc6820d01 About a minute ago 137MB Step 10.5: Enter this command to see information about the chaincode container. I introduce here the --no-trunc option, which stands for no truncation , so you can see more information about the container: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker ps --no-trunc | grep dev- 054fe600d195101a4e735bd213f433b41b40d7c1496bf325425e81fa5f789955 dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0-7e92f069adb7469939a96dcba723fa2019745461f05a562e81cec38e46424aa1 \"chaincode -peer.address=peer0.unitedmarbles.com:7052\" About a minute ago Up About a minute dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0 The takeaway is that the chaincode execution has only run on peer0 of Org0MSP so far, and this is also the peer on which you instantiated the chaincode, so the Docker image for the chaincode, and the corresponding Docker container based on the image, have been created for only this peer. You will see soon that other peers will have their own chaincode Docker image and Docker container built the first time they are needed. Step 10.6: You created a marble owner in the previous step. Now create a marble belonging to this owner. Perform this from peer0 of Org1, so from Terminal session 1, switch to Peer0 of Org1MSP: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# source scripts/setpeer 1 0 CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/marblesinc.com/peers/peer0.marblesinc.com/tls/ca.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.key CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/server.crt CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/marblesinc.com/users/Admin@marblesinc.com/msp CORE_PEER_ID=cli CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.marblesinc.com:7051 Step 10.7: Now enter the command to create a new marble for John: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"init_marble\",\"m0000000000001\",\"blue\",\"35\",\"o0000000000001\",\"Marbles Inc\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME 2018-10-22 19:28:54.043 UTC [chaincodeCmd] InitCmdFactory - INFO 001 Retrieved channel (mychannel) orderer endpoint: orderer.blockchain.com:7050 2018-10-22 19:29:08.962 UTC [chaincodeCmd] chaincodeInvokeOrQuery - INFO 002 Chaincode invoke successful. result: status:200 This time you called the init_marble function. Now you have created one owner, and one marble. The owner is John (or your custom name) and his id is o0000000000001 , and his marble has an id of m0000000000001 . I cleverly decided that the letter ' o ' stands for owner and the letter ' m ' stands for marbles. I put 12 leading zeros in front of the number 1 in case you wanted to stay late and create trillions of marbles and owners. Step 10.8: In Terminal session 2, issue the command to see that you have two Docker chaincode images: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker images dev-* REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE dev-peer0.marblesinc.com-marbles-1.0-4077677f13838bacbfd8ff943e7348c00f3c4d6ca6e2838efd14204ca87ea12b latest 10f11ae0735b 3 seconds ago 137MB dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0-7e92f069adb7469939a96dcba723fa2019745461f05a562e81cec38e46424aa1 latest 9f1fc6820d01 2 minutes ago 137MB Step 10.9: In Terminal session 2, issue the command to see that you have two Docker chaincode containers: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker ps --no-trunc | grep dev-* 22d63701f033c108296dd5170b67d5a1a00a8bb8b93197bc95e8303bcfc5657a dev-peer0.marblesinc.com-marbles-1.0-4077677f13838bacbfd8ff943e7348c00f3c4d6ca6e2838efd14204ca87ea12b \"chaincode -peer.address=peer0.marblesinc.com:7052\" 28 seconds ago Up 27 seconds dev-peer0.marblesinc.com-marbles-1.0 054fe600d195101a4e735bd213f433b41b40d7c1496bf325425e81fa5f789955 dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0-7e92f069adb7469939a96dcba723fa2019745461f05a562e81cec38e46424aa1 \"chaincode -peer.address=peer0.unitedmarbles.com:7052\" 2 minutes ago Up 2 minutes dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0 bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ Step 10.10: You will create a new owner now.

Note: This command is intended to fail. Go ahead and enter it and then read on for why it failed and how to correct the failure : root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"init_owner\",\"o0000000000002\",\"Barry\",\"United Marbles\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME What do you expect to happen when you enter this command? If you have followed these instructions exactly so far, the invoke will fail. It will fail because you have not yet installed the chaincode on Peer 1 of Org0. Here is the output which shows the error: 2018-10-22 19:43:00.238 UTC [chaincodeCmd] InitCmdFactory - INFO 001 Retrieved channel (mychannel) orderer endpoint: orderer.blockchain.com:7050 Error: endorsement failure during invoke. response: status:500 message:\"cannot retrieve package for chaincode marbles/1.0, error open /var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/marbles.1.0: no such file or directory\" You must first install chaincode on a peer not only before you can do an instantiate from that peer, but also before you can do an invoke or query from that peer. If you want a peer to perform the endorsing function for a transaction, the chaincode for that transaction must be installed on that peer. If that peer is a member of the channel on which the chaincode is instantiated, but has not had the chaincode installed on it, it will still perform the committer function and update its copy of the channel's ledger when it receives valid transactions from the orderer, but it cannot endorse transaction proposals unless the chaincode has been installed on it. Step 10.12 : Correct things by installing the chaincode on peer1 of Org0.

It should work this time: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"init_owner\",\"o0000000000002\",\"Barry\",\"United Marbles\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME 2018-10-22 19:45:10.249 UTC [chaincodeCmd] InitCmdFactory - INFO 001 Retrieved channel (mychannel) orderer endpoint: orderer.blockchain.com:7050 2018-10-22 19:45:25.582 UTC [chaincodeCmd] chaincodeInvokeOrQuery - INFO 002 Chaincode invoke successful. result: status:200 Step 10.14: Go back to Terminal session 2 and enter the Docker command that will show you that you now have your third chaincode-related Docker image, the one just built for peer1 of Org0: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker images dev-* REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE dev-peer1.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0-dea1aa08dc7c6f282a31dd498670173c21d3e75ef0ef1d170b95e1212fbacb77 latest 39d2292b2c9f 29 seconds ago 137MB dev-peer0.marblesinc.com-marbles-1.0-4077677f13838bacbfd8ff943e7348c00f3c4d6ca6e2838efd14204ca87ea12b latest 10f11ae0735b 16 minutes ago 137MB dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0-7e92f069adb7469939a96dcba723fa2019745461f05a562e81cec38e46424aa1 latest 9f1fc6820d01 19 minutes ago 137MB Step 10.15: Enter the Docker command that will show you that you now have your third chaincode-related Docker container, the one just built for peer1 of Org0: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ docker ps --no-trunc | grep dev- 9fb400ec36af291ab8e153b9fc61d75536ac29f43d2f3f28e37a119adc09de31 dev-peer1.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0-dea1aa08dc7c6f282a31dd498670173c21d3e75ef0ef1d170b95e1212fbacb77 \"chaincode -peer.address=peer1.unitedmarbles.com:7052\" 59 seconds ago Up 58 seconds dev-peer1.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0 22d63701f033c108296dd5170b67d5a1a00a8bb8b93197bc95e8303bcfc5657a dev-peer0.marblesinc.com-marbles-1.0-4077677f13838bacbfd8ff943e7348c00f3c4d6ca6e2838efd14204ca87ea12b \"chaincode -peer.address=peer0.marblesinc.com:7052\" 17 minutes ago Up 17 minutes dev-peer0.marblesinc.com-marbles-1.0 054fe600d195101a4e735bd213f433b41b40d7c1496bf325425e81fa5f789955 dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0-7e92f069adb7469939a96dcba723fa2019745461f05a562e81cec38e46424aa1 \"chaincode -peer.address=peer0.unitedmarbles.com:7052\" 19 minutes ago Up 19 minutes dev-peer0.unitedmarbles.com-marbles-1.0 bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ Step 10.16: Try some additional chaincode invocations. You have had enough experience switching between peers with source scripts/setpeer and issuing the peer chaincode invoke command that I will not show the output, nor tell you from which peer you should enter your command. I will just list several more commands you can run against the marbles chaincode. Feel free to switch amongst the four peers as you see fit before you enter each command. Note however, that you have only installed the chaincode on three of the four peers, so if you choose that fourth peer, you will need to install the chaincode there first. I won't tell you which peer does not currently have the chaincode installed, but if you need a hint, it is the one that does not have a Docker image built yet for its chaincode. (Note that checking for the absence of a Docker image for a peer is not, by itself,proof that you have not installed the chaincode on that peer- the Docker image is not built until you first invoke a function against the chaincode on that peer). If you are ambitious and want to install the chaincode on that fourth peer, try the useful Docker commands I have shown you from PuTTY session 2 to see that the chaincode's Docker image and Docker container are created when you invoke a transaction on that fourth peer. Try some or all of these commands from Terminal session 1: Create a marble for Barry, i.e., owner o0000000000002: peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"init_marble\",\"m0000000000002\",\"green\",\"50\",\"o0000000000002\",\"United Marbles\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME Obtain all marble information- marbles and owners: peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"read_everything\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME Change marble ownership- 'Barry' is giving his marble to 'John': peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"set_owner\",\"m0000000000002\",\"o0000000000001\",\"United Marbles\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME Get the history of marble 'm0000000000002': peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"getHistory\",\"m0000000000002\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME Delete marble 'm0000000000002': peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"delete_marble\",\"m0000000000002\",\"Marbles Inc\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME Try again to get the history of marble 'm0000000000002' after you just deleted it: peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"getHistory\",\"m0000000000002\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME Obtain all marble information again. See if it matches your expectations based on the commands you have entered: peer chaincode invoke -n marbles -c '{\"Args\":[\"read_everything\"]}' $FABRIC_TLS -C $CHANNEL_NAME Step 10.17: Exit the cli Docker container from Terminal session 1. Your command prompt should change to reflect that you are now back at your Linux on IBM Z host prompt and no longer in the Docker container: root@acd1f96d8807:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# exit exit bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles$ Step 10.18: Congratulations for making it through the treacherous portion of the lab! Stay logged in to your two terminal sessions and leave your Hyperledger Fabric network and all the chaincode Docker containers up and running- you will use what you created here in Part 2 of the lab where you will install a front-end application offering a browser-based UI from which you will interact with the marbles chaincode that you have installed in here in Part 1.","title":"Section 10 - Invoke chaincode functions"},{"location":"hlf-part2/","text":"Section 1: Lab Part 2 Overview In this part of the lab, you will use the Hyperledger Fabric network that you created in the Part 1 of the lab and configure the Marbles User Interface (UI) web application so that it will integrate with the marbles chaincode that you installed in the previous lab. You will use two browser sessions to simulate acting as a user for each of the two organizations in the network- United Marbles and Marbles Inc . Then you can explore the Marbles UI to execute chaincode transactions and see some of the Hyperledger Fabric concepts in action. Section 2: Marbles user interface setup Step 2.1: Switch to the ~/zmarbles/marblesUI directory: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ cd ~/zmarbles/marblesUI bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI$ Step 2.2: You will need to do an npm install to install the packages needed by the Marbles user interface. First you will verify that the node_modules directory does not exist. This directory will be created when you run an npm install in the next step, so right now it shouldn't exist: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI$ ls -l node_modules ls: cannot access 'node_modules': No such file or directory Step 2.3: Now run the npm install : bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI$ npm install . . (output not shown here) . Step 2.4: When this command ends, list the node_modules directory again. It is there now: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI$ ls -l node_modules . . (output not shown here) . Step 2.5: Change to the config directory: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI$ cd config bcuser@ubuntu16045;~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ Step 2.6: There are four files in this directory: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ ls connection_profile1.json connection_profile2.json marbles1.json marbles2.json bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ Step 2.7: There are two files for the first fictitious company, United Marbles , and two files for the second fictitious company, Marbles Inc. Look at the marbles1.json file with the cat command: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ cat marbles1.json { \"cred_filename\": \"connection_profile1.json\", \"use_events\": false, \"keep_alive_secs\": 120, \"company\": \"United Marbles\", \"usernames\": [ \"amy\", \"alice\", \"ava\" ], \"port\": 3001, \"last_startup_hash\": \"\" } Step 2.8: Notice that this file points to one of the other existing files, connection_profile1.json , as the value of the cred_filename name/value pair. You will look at that in a moment. Take a note of the usernames array- amy , alice , and ava . If you are comfortable with the vi editor you could change those names to your favorite names if you would like. You can also use the sed command to change the name inline without entering vi . Here is an example of a command to change the name alice to vincent . This step is optional- you do not have to do this is you prefer the name alice to vincent : bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ sed -i \"s/alice/vincent/\" marbles1.json # optional bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ Step 2.9: Here is the file after I changed alice to vincent with the previous sed command: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ cat marbles1.json { \"cred_filename\": \"connection_profile1.json\", \"use_events\": false, \"keep_alive_secs\": 120, \"company\": \"United Marbles\", \"usernames\": [ \"amy\", \"vincent\", \"ava\" ], \"port\": 3001, \"last_startup_hash\": \"\" } NOTE: Your file will look different if you choose to skip the optional Step 2.9 or if you made changes other than the example change I showed. The purpose of this step is to ensure that your file changed the way you intended it to (if it changed at all). The other key thing to note is the port number. It is 3001 here. In the marbles2.json file for Marbles Inc , port 3002 will be specified. This is how, later in this lab, you will pretend to be a user of one company or the other- by using port 3001 in the URL to pretend to be a \"United Marbles\" user and by using port 3002 in the URL to pretend to be a \"Marbles Inc\" user. Step 2.10: It is time to look at the main configuration file the Marbles app uses. It is the file specified as the cred_filename value in the marbles1.json file. This name cred_filename for the JSON name/value pair and the filename, blockchain_creds1.json , indicate that security credentials are specified in this file, and they are, but actually information about the Hyperledger Fabric network itself is specified in this file as well. This file is too large to fit in one screen, so I will teach you one more Linux command, named more . (Pun intended). Type this: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ more connection_profile1.json This command will print as much of the file as it can on your screen but will pause until you hit enter before displaying the rest of the file's contents. Here are the complete contents of this file: { \"name\": \"Docker Compose Network\", \"x-networkId\": \"not-important\", \"x-type\": \"hlfv1\", \"description\": \"Connection Profile for an IBM Blockchain Network\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"client\": { \"organization\": \"Org0MSP\" }, \"channels\": { \"mychannel\": { \"orderers\": [ \"fabric-orderer\" ], \"peers\": { \"fabric-peer-org1\" : { \"x-chaincode\": {} } }, \"chaincodes\": [ \"marbles:v4\" ], \"x-blockDelay\": 1000 } }, \"organizations\": { \"Org0MSP\": { \"mspid\": \"Org0MSP\", \"peers\": [ \"fabric-peer-org1\" ], \"certificateAuthorities\": [ \"fabric-ca-org1\" ] } }, \"orderers\": { \"fabric-orderer\": { \"url\": \"grpcs://localhost:7050\", \"grpcOptions\": { \"ssl-target-name-override\": \"orderer.blockchain.com\", \"grpc.http2.keepalive_time\": 300, \"grpc.keepalive_time_ms\": 300000, \"grpc.http2.keepalive_timeout\": 35, \"grpc.keepalive_timeout_ms\": 3500 }, \"tlsCACerts\": { \"path\": \"../../crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/blockchain.com/orderers/orderer.blockchain.com/tls/ca.crt\" } } }, \"peers\": { \"fabric-peer-org1\": { \"url\": \"grpcs://localhost:7051\", \"eventUrl\": \"grpcs://localhost:7053\", \"grpcOptions\": { \"ssl-target-name-override\": \"peer0.unitedmarbles.com\", \"grpc.http2.keepalive_time\": 300, \"grpc.keepalive_time_ms\": 300000, \"grpc.http2.keepalive_timeout\": 35, \"grpc.keepalive_timeout_ms\": 3500 }, \"tlsCACerts\": { \"path\": \"../../crypto-config/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/ca.crt\" } } }, \"certificateAuthorities\": { \"fabric-ca-org1\": { \"url\": \"https://localhost:7054\", \"httpOptions\": { \"ssl-target-name-override\": \"ca.unitedmarbles.com\", \"verify\": true }, \"tlsCACerts\": { \"path\": \"../../crypto-config/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/ca/ca.unitedmarbles.com-cert.pem\" }, \"registrar\": [ { \"enrollId\": \"admin\", \"enrollSecret\": \"adminpw\" } ], \"caName\": \"ca-org0\" } } } This is a standard Hyperledger Fabric connection profile. This lab does not use Hyperledger Composer, but I think the Hyperledger Composer team did a nice job describing Hyperledger Fabric connection profiles, as they use them too. See https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/reference/connectionprofile for their description. They also reference a link in the Hyperledger Fabric Node.js SDK documentation at https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/tutorial-network-config.html which is a little more advanced, and it describes the profile in YAML form versus the JSON form that this Marbles demo app uses. IMPORTANT: if you used a channel name other than the default of mychannel, you must change this value from mychannel to the value you used. Either use the vi editor if you are comfortable with that, or, you could use sed . For example, here is a sed command, to change the channel name from mychannel to tim , along with \"before\" and \"after\" grep commands to show the changes (These commands are examples and only needed if you did not use the default channel name of mychannel) : bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ grep mychannel connection_profile[12].json blockchain_creds1.json: \"channel_id\": \"mychannel\", blockchain_creds2.json: \"channel_id\": \"mychannel\", bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ sed -i \"s/mychannel/tim/\" connection_profile[12].json bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ grep -1 channels connection_profile[12].json connection_profile1.json- }, connection_profile1.json: \"channels\": { connection_profile1.json- \"tim\": { -- connection_profile2.json- }, connection_profile2.json: \"channels\": { connection_profile2.json- \"tim\": { Step 2.11: The considerations for marbles2.json and connection_profile2.json are the same as for marbles1.json and connection_profile1.json except that they apply to \"Marbles Inc.\" instead of \"United Marbles\". If you would like to compare the differences between connection_profile1.json and connection_profile2.json , try the diff command and observe its output. This command lists sections of the two files that it finds different. The lines from the first file, blockchain_creds1.json , start with ' ' (added by the diff command output, not in the actual file), and the lines from the second file, blockchain_creds2.json , start with '>': bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ diff connection_profile1.json connection_profile2.json 8c8 \"organization\": \"Org0MSP\" --- \"organization\": \"Org1MSP\" 16c16 \"fabric-peer-org1\" : { --- \"fabric-peer-org2\" : { 27,28c27,28 \"Org0MSP\": { \"mspid\": \"Org0MSP\", --- \"Org1MSP\": { \"mspid\": \"Org1MSP\", 30c30 \"fabric-peer-org1\" --- \"fabric-peer-org2\" 33c33 \"fabric-ca-org1\" --- \"fabric-ca-org2\" 54,56c54,56 \"fabric-peer-org1\": { \"url\": \"grpcs://localhost:7051\", \"eventUrl\": \"grpcs://localhost:7053\", --- \"fabric-peer-org2\": { \"url\": \"grpcs://localhost:9051\", \"eventUrl\": \"grpcs://localhost:9053\", 58c58 \"ssl-target-name-override\": \"peer0.unitedmarbles.com\", --- \"ssl-target-name-override\": \"peer0.marblesinc.com\", 65c65 \"path\": \"../../crypto-config/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/ca.crt\" --- \"path\": \"../../crypto-config/peerOrganizations/marblesinc.com/peers/peer0.marblesinc.com/tls/ca.crt\" 70,71c70,71 \"fabric-ca-org1\": { \"url\": \"https://localhost:7054\", --- \"fabric-ca-org2\": { \"url\": \"https://localhost:8054\", 73c73 \"ssl-target-name-override\": \"ca.unitedmarbles.com\", --- \"ssl-target-name-override\": \"ca.marblesinc.com\", 77c77 \"path\": \"../../crypto-config/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/ca/ca.unitedmarbles.com-cert.pem\" --- \"path\": \"../../crypto-config/peerOrganizations/marblesinc.com/ca/ca.marblesinc.com-cert.pem\" 81,82c81,82 \"enrollId\": \"admin\", \"enrollSecret\": \"adminpw\" --- \"enrollId\": \"admin2\", \"enrollSecret\": \"adminpw2\" 85c85 \"caName\": \"ca-org0\" --- \"caName\": \"ca-org1\" Section 3: Start the Marbles user interface In this section, you will use the Marbles user interface. You will start two browser sessions- one will be as a \"United Marbles\" user, and the other as a \"Marbles Inc\" user. Here in this lab, you are serving both companies' applications from the same server, so you will differentiate between the two companies by the port number. You will connect to port 3001 when acting as a United Marbles user, and you will connect to port 3002 when acting as a Marbles Inc user. In the real world, each of the two companies would probably either serve the user interface from their own server, or perhaps both companies would log in to a server provided by a service provider- think \"Blockchain-as-a-service\". The chosen topology is use-case dependent and beyond the scope of this lab. Step 3.1: You are now ready to start the server for UnitedMarbles. Back up to the ~/zmarbles/marblesUI directory: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ cd .. bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI$ Step 3.2: You will now use gulp to start up the server, with this command: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI$ gulp marbles1 [12:58:04] Using gulpfile ~/zmarbles/marblesUI/gulpfile.js [12:58:04] Starting 'env_tls'...

The marbles1 task specifies four more tasks to run, the first of which is env_tls . This task is adding a value to a map named env . This value points to the marbles1.json file: gulp.task('env_tls', function () { env['creds_filename'] = 'marbles1.json'; }); The last of the tasks, server , when it is started, is receiving this map named env as part of its invocation: gulp.task('server', function(a, b) { if(node) node.kill(); node = spawn('node', ['app.js'], {env: env, stdio: 'inherit'}); //command, file, options }); The syntax is a bit arcane, and this is not a course in JavaScript, but there is a line in the main file for the server, app.js , that reads this creds_filename value: var cp = require(__dirname + '/utils/connection_profile_lib/index.js')(process.env.creds_filename, logger); Then within utils/connection_profile_lib/index.js is where all the magic, a.k.a. code, happens to make use of the values specified in that file. You did not need to know all this to run the application, but you might need to know where to start looking when your boss asks you to tailor the marbles application because she wants a return on the time and money you spent taking this lab- assuming you don't get off the hook when you tell her that nowhere was JavaScript mentioned on the agenda. Step 3.3: Open up a web browser window or tab and point to http:// your_IP_goes_here>:3001 . Substitute your team's assigned IP address instead of your_IP_goes_here> . You should see a window pop up that looks like this: Step 3.4: You are given a choice between Express and Guided for setting up the demo. Don't short-change yourself- pick Guided , you'll learn more. After you click Guided , you will see this: Read the text in the window to see what's going on. Step 3.5: If you do not see Step 1 Complete , ask an instructor for help. Otherwise, click Next Step and you should see this: Click the '+' sign if you wish to see the settings used to contact the Fabric Certificate Authority.

Otherwise, click Next Step and you should see this: Click the '+' sign to see information about your environment and your marbles chaincode. Step 3.7: If you do not see Step 3 Complete , ask an instructor for help. Otherwise, click Next Step and you should see this: Step 3.8: Unlike the first three steps, which did not require further input from you to complete, this step will not proceed until you click the Create button. Before you do that you have an opportunity to review and change the names that you use for new marbles owners in addition to the owner named 'Barry' that should already exist (though not evident from this screen) if you created it in the first part of this lab. Click the Create button when you are ready and after several seconds you should see Step 4 Complete on the screen: Step 3.9: If you do not see Step 4 Complete , ask an instructor for help. Otherwise, click Next Step and you should see this: This should just give you a smiley face and a message saying that setup is complete. Step 3.10: Click Enter and you should be returned to a screen that looks similar to this (your names may differ): Step 3.11: What about John's marble for Marbles Inc.? You only started up the server for United Marbles, so why does Marbles Inc show up and why is John so lonely? When you did the previous lab, the first two commands I had you do were an init_owner for John, tying him to Marbles Inc, and then an init_marble , giving him a marble. Remember, the \"blockchain\" is shared among all participants of the channel, so United Marbles and Marbles Inc both see the same chain- they see each other's marbles. But the user names specified in config/marbles2.json are not created until you start the server for marbles2 and log in the first time. List the contents of marbles2.json file (switch to a free PuTTY session or start a new one), e.g.: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ cd ~/zmarbles/marblesUI bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI$ cat config/marbles2.json { \"cred_filename\": \"connection_profile2.json\", \"use_events\": false, \"keep_alive_secs\": 120, \"company\": \"Marbles Inc\", \"usernames\": [ \"cliff\", \"cody\", \"chuck\" ], \"port\": 3002, \"last_startup_hash\": \"\" } Step 3.12: Start the second server, the one for Marbles Inc: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI$ gulp marbles2 [13:12:59] Using gulpfile ~/zmarbles/marblesUI/gulpfile.js [13:12:59] Starting 'env_tls2'...

Step 3.13: Open a browser tab or window and navigate to http:// your_IP_here>:3002 . You will again be given a choice of Express or Guided and feel free to choose whichever path suits your fancy. If you choose Express , everything should hopefully sail through until you see a screen with all Marbles Inc. owners and marbles, as well as all United Marbles owners and marbles: Step 3.14: If you go back to your screen for United Marbles (port 3001) you should observe that it has been updated to show the owners and marbles for Marbles Inc. in addition to United Marbles' own owners and marbles: Remember, you are looking at the United Marbles session but you see all the new users and marbles created by the Marbles Inc administrator. Step 3.15: Play with your marbles!! Here are some things you can do. When you do things as one user, e.g. as the United Marbles admin, go to the other user's screen to see that the changes one organization makes are visible to the other organization: On two different browser sessions, you should be logged in as the administrator for each of the two fictitious companies. When you are the United Marbles administrator, you can create marbles for you or anybody in United Marbles. You can delete marbles for you or anybody in United Marbles. You can take marbles from anybody in United Marbles and give them to anybody in the network, even to Marbles Inc people. (And vice versa when you are a Marbles Inc administrator). Try clicking on the little magnifying glass to the left of the browser window and follow the directions Right click on a marble (Hint: this is the same as using the magnifying glass) Click on the Settings button and Enable story mode. Try an action that is allowed, and try an action that shouldn't be allowed, such as trying to steal a marble from the other company. Disable story mode when it gets too tedious, which shouldn't take long. Step 3.16: If you want that extra rush, try these optional advanced assignments: Break out the previous lab's material and enter the cli container and issue some commands to create, update or delete marbles. See if the Marbles UI reflects your changes Look at some of the marbles chaincode container logs while you work with the Marbles UI - Hint: docker logs [-f] container_name will show a container's log. Try it without the optional -f argument first and then try it with it. -f ties up your terminal session but then shows new log messages as they are created. Press Ctrl-c to get out of it. Look at the peer or orderer logs while you work with the Marbles UI * Click the Start Up Help button in the upper left in the Marbles UI and then number 4 in the window that pops up. Edit the list of names at the bottom and click Create . Do your new users show up in both companies' sessions? What happens if you add a name that exists already? End of lab!","title":"Part 2"},{"location":"hlf-part2/#section-1-lab-part-2-overview","text":"In this part of the lab, you will use the Hyperledger Fabric network that you created in the Part 1 of the lab and configure the Marbles User Interface (UI) web application so that it will integrate with the marbles chaincode that you installed in the previous lab. You will use two browser sessions to simulate acting as a user for each of the two organizations in the network- United Marbles and Marbles Inc . Then you can explore the Marbles UI to execute chaincode transactions and see some of the Hyperledger Fabric concepts in action.","title":"Section 1: Lab Part 2 Overview"},{"location":"hlf-part2/#section-2-marbles-user-interface-setup","text":"Step 2.1: Switch to the ~/zmarbles/marblesUI directory: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ cd ~/zmarbles/marblesUI bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI$ Step 2.2: You will need to do an npm install to install the packages needed by the Marbles user interface. First you will verify that the node_modules directory does not exist. This directory will be created when you run an npm install in the next step, so right now it shouldn't exist: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI$ ls -l node_modules ls: cannot access 'node_modules': No such file or directory Step 2.3: Now run the npm install : bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI$ npm install . . (output not shown here) . Step 2.4: When this command ends, list the node_modules directory again. It is there now: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI$ ls -l node_modules . . (output not shown here) . Step 2.5: Change to the config directory: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI$ cd config bcuser@ubuntu16045;~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ Step 2.6: There are four files in this directory: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ ls connection_profile1.json connection_profile2.json marbles1.json marbles2.json bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ Step 2.7: There are two files for the first fictitious company, United Marbles , and two files for the second fictitious company, Marbles Inc. Look at the marbles1.json file with the cat command: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ cat marbles1.json { \"cred_filename\": \"connection_profile1.json\", \"use_events\": false, \"keep_alive_secs\": 120, \"company\": \"United Marbles\", \"usernames\": [ \"amy\", \"alice\", \"ava\" ], \"port\": 3001, \"last_startup_hash\": \"\" } Step 2.8: Notice that this file points to one of the other existing files, connection_profile1.json , as the value of the cred_filename name/value pair. You will look at that in a moment. Take a note of the usernames array- amy , alice , and ava . If you are comfortable with the vi editor you could change those names to your favorite names if you would like. You can also use the sed command to change the name inline without entering vi . Here is an example of a command to change the name alice to vincent . This step is optional- you do not have to do this is you prefer the name alice to vincent : bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ sed -i \"s/alice/vincent/\" marbles1.json # optional bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ Step 2.9: Here is the file after I changed alice to vincent with the previous sed command: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ cat marbles1.json { \"cred_filename\": \"connection_profile1.json\", \"use_events\": false, \"keep_alive_secs\": 120, \"company\": \"United Marbles\", \"usernames\": [ \"amy\", \"vincent\", \"ava\" ], \"port\": 3001, \"last_startup_hash\": \"\" } NOTE: Your file will look different if you choose to skip the optional Step 2.9 or if you made changes other than the example change I showed. The purpose of this step is to ensure that your file changed the way you intended it to (if it changed at all). The other key thing to note is the port number. It is 3001 here. In the marbles2.json file for Marbles Inc , port 3002 will be specified. This is how, later in this lab, you will pretend to be a user of one company or the other- by using port 3001 in the URL to pretend to be a \"United Marbles\" user and by using port 3002 in the URL to pretend to be a \"Marbles Inc\" user. Step 2.10: It is time to look at the main configuration file the Marbles app uses. It is the file specified as the cred_filename value in the marbles1.json file. This name cred_filename for the JSON name/value pair and the filename, blockchain_creds1.json , indicate that security credentials are specified in this file, and they are, but actually information about the Hyperledger Fabric network itself is specified in this file as well. This file is too large to fit in one screen, so I will teach you one more Linux command, named more . (Pun intended). Type this: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ more connection_profile1.json This command will print as much of the file as it can on your screen but will pause until you hit enter before displaying the rest of the file's contents. Here are the complete contents of this file: { \"name\": \"Docker Compose Network\", \"x-networkId\": \"not-important\", \"x-type\": \"hlfv1\", \"description\": \"Connection Profile for an IBM Blockchain Network\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"client\": { \"organization\": \"Org0MSP\" }, \"channels\": { \"mychannel\": { \"orderers\": [ \"fabric-orderer\" ], \"peers\": { \"fabric-peer-org1\" : { \"x-chaincode\": {} } }, \"chaincodes\": [ \"marbles:v4\" ], \"x-blockDelay\": 1000 } }, \"organizations\": { \"Org0MSP\": { \"mspid\": \"Org0MSP\", \"peers\": [ \"fabric-peer-org1\" ], \"certificateAuthorities\": [ \"fabric-ca-org1\" ] } }, \"orderers\": { \"fabric-orderer\": { \"url\": \"grpcs://localhost:7050\", \"grpcOptions\": { \"ssl-target-name-override\": \"orderer.blockchain.com\", \"grpc.http2.keepalive_time\": 300, \"grpc.keepalive_time_ms\": 300000, \"grpc.http2.keepalive_timeout\": 35, \"grpc.keepalive_timeout_ms\": 3500 }, \"tlsCACerts\": { \"path\": \"../../crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/blockchain.com/orderers/orderer.blockchain.com/tls/ca.crt\" } } }, \"peers\": { \"fabric-peer-org1\": { \"url\": \"grpcs://localhost:7051\", \"eventUrl\": \"grpcs://localhost:7053\", \"grpcOptions\": { \"ssl-target-name-override\": \"peer0.unitedmarbles.com\", \"grpc.http2.keepalive_time\": 300, \"grpc.keepalive_time_ms\": 300000, \"grpc.http2.keepalive_timeout\": 35, \"grpc.keepalive_timeout_ms\": 3500 }, \"tlsCACerts\": { \"path\": \"../../crypto-config/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/peers/peer0.unitedmarbles.com/tls/ca.crt\" } } }, \"certificateAuthorities\": { \"fabric-ca-org1\": { \"url\": \"https://localhost:7054\", \"httpOptions\": { \"ssl-target-name-override\": \"ca.unitedmarbles.com\", \"verify\": true }, \"tlsCACerts\": { \"path\": \"../../crypto-config/peerOrganizations/unitedmarbles.com/ca/ca.unitedmarbles.com-cert.pem\" }, \"registrar\": [ { \"enrollId\": \"admin\", \"enrollSecret\": \"adminpw\" } ], \"caName\": \"ca-org0\" } } } This is a standard Hyperledger Fabric connection profile. This lab does not use Hyperledger Composer, but I think the Hyperledger Composer team did a nice job describing Hyperledger Fabric connection profiles, as they use them too. See https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/reference/connectionprofile for their description. They also reference a link in the Hyperledger Fabric Node.js SDK documentation at https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/tutorial-network-config.html which is a little more advanced, and it describes the profile in YAML form versus the JSON form that this Marbles demo app uses. IMPORTANT: if you used a channel name other than the default of mychannel, you must change this value from mychannel to the value you used. Either use the vi editor if you are comfortable with that, or, you could use sed . For example, here is a sed command, to change the channel name from mychannel to tim , along with \"before\" and \"after\" grep commands to show the changes (These commands are examples and only needed if you did not use the default channel name of mychannel) : bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ grep mychannel connection_profile[12].json blockchain_creds1.json: \"channel_id\": \"mychannel\", blockchain_creds2.json: \"channel_id\": \"mychannel\", bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ sed -i \"s/mychannel/tim/\" connection_profile[12].json bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI/config$ grep -1 channels connection_profile[12].json connection_profile1.json- }, connection_profile1.json: \"channels\": { connection_profile1.json- \"tim\": { -- connection_profile2.json- }, connection_profile2.json: \"channels\": { connection_profile2.json- \"tim\": { Step 2.11: The considerations for marbles2.json and connection_profile2.json are the same as for marbles1.json and connection_profile1.json except that they apply to \"Marbles Inc.\" instead of \"United Marbles\". If you would like to compare the differences between connection_profile1.json and connection_profile2.json , try the diff command and observe its output. This command lists sections of the two files that it finds different.

You will connect to port 3001 when acting as a United Marbles user, and you will connect to port 3002 when acting as a Marbles Inc user. In the real world, each of the two companies would probably either serve the user interface from their own server, or perhaps both companies would log in to a server provided by a service provider- think \"Blockchain-as-a-service\".

This value points to the marbles1.json file: gulp.task('env_tls', function () { env['creds_filename'] = 'marbles1.json'; }); The last of the tasks, server , when it is started, is receiving this map named env as part of its invocation: gulp.task('server', function(a, b) { if(node) node.kill(); node = spawn('node', ['app.js'], {env: env, stdio: 'inherit'}); //command, file, options }); The syntax is a bit arcane, and this is not a course in JavaScript, but there is a line in the main file for the server, app.js , that reads this creds_filename value: var cp = require(__dirname + '/utils/connection_profile_lib/index.js')(process.env.creds_filename, logger); Then within utils/connection_profile_lib/index.js is where all the magic, a.k.a. code, happens to make use of the values specified in that file. You did not need to know all this to run the application, but you might need to know where to start looking when your boss asks you to tailor the marbles application because she wants a return on the time and money you spent taking this lab- assuming you don't get off the hook when you tell her that nowhere was JavaScript mentioned on the agenda. Step 3.3: Open up a web browser window or tab and point to http:// your_IP_goes_here>:3001 . Substitute your team's assigned IP address instead of your_IP_goes_here> . You should see a window pop up that looks like this: Step 3.4: You are given a choice between Express and Guided for setting up the demo. Don't short-change yourself- pick Guided , you'll learn more. After you click Guided , you will see this: Read the text in the window to see what's going on. Step 3.5: If you do not see Step 1 Complete , ask an instructor for help. Otherwise, click Next Step and you should see this: Click the '+' sign if you wish to see the settings used to contact the Fabric Certificate Authority. Step 3.6: If you do not see Step 2 Complete , ask an instructor for help. Otherwise, click Next Step and you should see this: Click the '+' sign to see information about your environment and your marbles chaincode. Step 3.7: If you do not see Step 3 Complete , ask an instructor for help. Otherwise, click Next Step and you should see this: Step 3.8: Unlike the first three steps, which did not require further input from you to complete, this step will not proceed until you click the Create button. Before you do that you have an opportunity to review and change the names that you use for new marbles owners in addition to the owner named 'Barry' that should already exist (though not evident from this screen) if you created it in the first part of this lab. Click the Create button when you are ready and after several seconds you should see Step 4 Complete on the screen: Step 3.9: If you do not see Step 4 Complete , ask an instructor for help. Otherwise, click Next Step and you should see this: This should just give you a smiley face and a message saying that setup is complete. Step 3.10: Click Enter and you should be returned to a screen that looks similar to this (your names may differ): Step 3.11: What about John's marble for Marbles Inc.? You only started up the server for United Marbles, so why does Marbles Inc show up and why is John so lonely? When you did the previous lab, the first two commands I had you do were an init_owner for John, tying him to Marbles Inc, and then an init_marble , giving him a marble. Remember, the \"blockchain\" is shared among all participants of the channel, so United Marbles and Marbles Inc both see the same chain- they see each other's marbles. But the user names specified in config/marbles2.json are not created until you start the server for marbles2 and log in the first time. List the contents of marbles2.json file (switch to a free PuTTY session or start a new one), e.g.: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~$ cd ~/zmarbles/marblesUI bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI$ cat config/marbles2.json { \"cred_filename\": \"connection_profile2.json\", \"use_events\": false, \"keep_alive_secs\": 120, \"company\": \"Marbles Inc\", \"usernames\": [ \"cliff\", \"cody\", \"chuck\" ], \"port\": 3002, \"last_startup_hash\": \"\" } Step 3.12: Start the second server, the one for Marbles Inc: bcuser@ubuntu16045:~/zmarbles/marblesUI$ gulp marbles2 [13:12:59] Using gulpfile ~/zmarbles/marblesUI/gulpfile.js [13:12:59] Starting 'env_tls2'...

Step 3.13: Open a browser tab or window and navigate to http:// your_IP_here>:3002 . You will again be given a choice of Express or Guided and feel free to choose whichever path suits your fancy. If you choose Express , everything should hopefully sail through until you see a screen with all Marbles Inc. owners and marbles, as well as all United Marbles owners and marbles: Step 3.14: If you go back to your screen for United Marbles (port 3001) you should observe that it has been updated to show the owners and marbles for Marbles Inc. in addition to United Marbles' own owners and marbles: Remember, you are looking at the United Marbles session but you see all the new users and marbles created by the Marbles Inc administrator. Step 3.15: Play with your marbles!! Here are some things you can do. When you do things as one user, e.g. as the United Marbles admin, go to the other user's screen to see that the changes one organization makes are visible to the other organization: On two different browser sessions, you should be logged in as the administrator for each of the two fictitious companies. When you are the United Marbles administrator, you can create marbles for you or anybody in United Marbles. You can delete marbles for you or anybody in United Marbles. You can take marbles from anybody in United Marbles and give them to anybody in the network, even to Marbles Inc people. (And vice versa when you are a Marbles Inc administrator). Try clicking on the little magnifying glass to the left of the browser window and follow the directions Right click on a marble (Hint: this is the same as using the magnifying glass) Click on the Settings button and Enable story mode. Try an action that is allowed, and try an action that shouldn't be allowed, such as trying to steal a marble from the other company. Disable story mode when it gets too tedious, which shouldn't take long. Step 3.16: If you want that extra rush, try these optional advanced assignments: Break out the previous lab's material and enter the cli container and issue some commands to create, update or delete marbles. See if the Marbles UI reflects your changes Look at some of the marbles chaincode container logs while you work with the Marbles UI - Hint: docker logs [-f] container_name will show a container's log. Try it without the optional -f argument first and then try it with it. -f ties up your terminal session but then shows new log messages as they are created. Press Ctrl-c to get out of it. Look at the peer or orderer logs while you work with the Marbles UI * Click the Start Up Help button in the upper left in the Marbles UI and then number 4 in the window that pops up. Edit the list of names at the bottom and click Create . Do your new users show up in both companies' sessions? What happens if you add a name that exists already?

Before all of that, we will have you start up the local Hyperledger Fabric network so that we can build our smart contract on top of it. In this lab, we have you deploy to a local network that is running on your laptop, but you can also connect the IBM Blockchain Platform VSCode extension to either your IBM Blockchain Platform network running in the cloud or your IBM Blockchain Platform on IBM Cloud Private network on-premises. Below is a breakdown of Part 1 of our lab Install and Start up a Blockchain Network: We must make sure that all levels of software (docker, node, npm, docker-compose and yo) are at the correct level before we start building our smart contract. Then, we will install the IBM Blockchain Platform extension that will allow us to create and develop our smart contract. Once we have done that, we will then start up the Hyperledger Fabric network, which will consist of a certificate authority (CA), orderer (solo - meant for dev/test), couchdb, ccenv (chaincode environment), and most importantly our peer. Create our Smart Contract: Now that we have a running Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network, we will create our smart contract. The smart contract will be very basic in nature, but we will explain what the contract is trying to accomplish before we go through some of the unique features that the extension can do for us and our smart contract. Package, Install and Instantiate our Smart Contract: Since we have an understanding of how our smart contract works, we will need to install (peer level command) it on our peer and then instantiate (channel level command) the installed smart contract on the channel. Once we have instantiated the smart contract, we will be able to submit transactions. Unit Test our Smart Contract: Once we have an instantiated smart contract on our channel, we will then test out the code to make sure that the contract will actually work when we submit transactions. This checks all the files within our smart contract and simulates all of our transactions. We will know we are cooking with gas when our test comes back successful. This test feature does not actually commit anything to the ledger or world state, but the last section of part 1 of this lab will submit tests that will commit data to the ledger. We will go into detail once we get to that point. Submit Transactions: What fun is it to have a working smart contract and have it instantiated across the channel, if we can't submit transactions? In this section, we will actually submit transactions from the UI of VSCode. We will see data get committed to the ledger. Generate Smart Contract Test Client: In the final section of part 1, we will generate a test file that will test our smart contract, while submitting transactions to the ledger. We will view the docker logs of our running smart contract and see the transactions being added to the logs as well as the ledger. Section 2: Install and Start Up a Blockchain Network NOTE: For Part 1 of our lab, we will be using the terminal within VSCode. Do not execute the commands within the actual terminal application. You can enter them from the terminal application, but the instructions below will all be within the VSCode terminal. Part 2 of this lab, you will use the terminal application. 1. Open up your teminal and type in the following commands below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~$ node -v # We want Node to be v8.x or higher v8.11.3 tecadmin@ubuntubase:~$ npm -v # We want NPM to be v5.x or higher 5.6.0 tecadmin@ubuntubase:~$ yo --version # We want yo to be v2.x or higher 2.0.5 tecadmin@ubuntubase:~$ docker --version # We want Docker to be v17.06.2-ce or higher Docker version 17.06.2-ce, build cec0b72 tecadmin@ubuntubase:~$ docker-compose --version # We want Docker Compose to be v1.14.0 or higher docker-compose version 1.14.0, build c7bdf9e If you get a version that doesn't support our qualifications, raise your hand and tell the instructor. 2. From the same command line, enter the following command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~$ code This will start Visual Studio Code (VSCode) 3. From the user interface (UI) of VSCode, click on the 4th item down. This will allow you to search for available extensions to install and work from 4. In the search bar, type in blockchain and that should populate all the available extensions that deal with blockchain. The top choice should be the IBM Blockchain Platform extension. I promise we didn't manipulate the algothrim to make it the top choice! If you see the IBM Blockchain Platform (IBP) extension, please click on install to install the extension. 5. Once you have successfully installed the extension, you should see an outline of a block just below the extensions button (approximately, the 6th button in VSCode). Go ahead and click on that button. Once you do, you'll be welcomed with the IBM Blockchain Platform VSCode Homepage with the sides being divided into thirds. The IBM Blockchain Extension perspective is broken into thirds on the left. It is broken into Smart Contract Packages , Local Fabric Ops and Fabric Gateways . Smart Contract Packages is the home for all of our smart contracts that are packaged into .cds files. It packages these smart contracts based on the files that are in the Editor perspective. Now, just because there are packages here doesn't mean that the smart contract is actually installed and instantiated on the channel. To do that we can go to the Local Fabric Ops pane. The Local Fabric Ops is a place where we can quickly gather and see all of our network information. If you untoggle the Smart Contracts flag, we can see all the contracts that are installed and instantiated. We can install and instantiate smart contracts from the Local Fabric Ops field. The Channel field shows all of the channels that are in our blockchain network. By default when we do Start Fabric Runtime in the next command, we'll join a channel called mychannel . The Nodes field shows us all of the peers that are in our network. In the Organizations field, we'll see all the organizations that are in the network. You can have an organization with no peers (nodes - in this case), but you can't have a peer without an organization. An organization can have many peers. The last pane, Fabric Gateway , allows you to connect to a Hyperledger Fabric instance by an identity. In our case, it will be the Admin@org1.example.com of our local Fabric network. In Part 2 of this lab, we will create an identity and submit transactions from this new identity. 6. Hover your mouse over the Local Fabric Ops panel and we'll see three dots - ... - and click on those dots. We'll be presented with two options. Start Fabric Runtime and Teardown Fabric Runtime are those two options. We will want to click on Start Fabric Runtime in this case. This will start our local Hyperledger Fabric network. It will stand up a peer, certificate authority, orderer and a couchdb container. In addition to standing up these containers, it will join our peer to a channel called mychannel . The difference between Start Fabric Runtime and Teardown Fabric Runtime might be obvious, but Start Fabric Runtime grabs all of the Hyperledger Fabric images and starts them as containers. In addition, it builds the crypto material (certificates, public and private keys) and creates and joins a sample channel called mychannel . The other option, Teardown Fabric Runtime basically cleans up the network and removes all of the containers that Start Fabric Runtime builds. It does leave the Start Fabric Runtime docker images. To do a full cleanup, we will need to manually remove those images and containers. 7. How do we know if we have a successful blockchain network up and running? I'm glad you asked! We will see messages flooding the Output panel. We will want to see a message that resembles the one below [2/20/2019 7:26:54 PM] [INFO] 2019-02-21 00:26:34.756 UTC [cli.common] readBlock - INFO 002 Received block: 0 [2/20/2019 7:26:54 PM] [INFO] 2019-02-21 00:26:34.930 UTC [channelCmd] InitCmdFactory - INFO 001 Endorser and orderer connections initialized [2/20/2019 7:26:55 PM] [INFO] 2019-02-21 00:26:35.458 UTC [channelCmd] executeJoin - INFO 002 Successfully submitted proposal to join channel 8. We can verify that everything is up and working by entering the following docker ps -a command that will print out all of our containers Section 3: Create our Smart Contract Now that we have a local running Hyperledger Fabric network, let's create our Smart Contract that we will then install and instantiate onto our network. 1. We can do that by clicking on the gear icon in the bottom left and then clicking on Command Palette. This will give us the option to do a series of commands, some that are VSCode-related and some that are IBM Blockchain Platform-related. 2. You will notice a series of commands pop up. Go ahead and enter this command below into the search bar IBM Blockchain Platform: Create Smart Contract Project This command will generate a skeleton smart contract for us. We will walk through all that it generates in a second. 3. We might get a message that says Can this extension install missing npm packages before proceeding? Select yes if that message comes up. What it is installing is generator-fabric which is actually the generator that creates our skeleton smart contract. 4. We'll then get a message that says Chose smart contract language (esc to cancel) Choose JavaScript as our smart contract language of choice 5. Then will pop open a folder directory. Since we are starting a new project, let's create a new folder for our smart contract. We can call this folder mycontract . Then click on open to allow VSCode to generate our smart contract in that folder. 6. We will get another pop-up asking Choose how to open your new project We'll want to select Add to workplace to add it to our VSCode 7. So we have created our smart contract, but gosh darnit, where is it? Well, let's click on the Explorer in the top left. It's the first botton on our left side panel 8. From the Explorer page, we will see all the open tabs we have open in VSCode and then all the smart contracts we created in our workspace, which should only be our [mycontract]{.title-ref}. 9. If you navigate within this UI to lib/my-contract.js and click on my-contract.js it will open that file within VSCode. From there we can inspect this file to see what our smart contract is capable of. In this case, we only have instantiate, transaction1 and transaction2 The main file in our smart contract is the my-contract.js file. It contains information as to the various transactions we can do as well as pulling in some predefined classes. Take a look at these lines in the code These couple of lines are vital to understand what is happening in our smart contract, below. The MyContract class contains the transaction definitions for mycontract - like instantiate, transaction1 and transaction2. It's these transactions that bring mycontract into existence. We'll examine these transactions soon, but for now notice how MyContract extends the Hyperledger Fabric Contract class which is the first line of code here. Our mycontract will use built-in features of these classes, such as automatic method invocation, a per-transaction context, transaction handlers, and class-shared state const { Contract } = require('fabric-contract-api'); class MyContract extends Contract { You might have noticed an extra variable in each transaction definition -- ctx . It's called the transaction context, and it's always first. By default, it maintains both per-contract and per-transaction information relevant to transaction logic. We also see that transaction1 expects 1 argument in addition to ctx and transaction2 expects 2 different arugments in addition to ctx. The instantiate transaction expects an instantiate argument when actually instantiating this smart contract. You can see that below. In fact, we will instantiate in the next section async instantiate(ctx) { console.info('instantiate'); } async transaction1(ctx, arg1) { console.info('transaction1', arg1); } async transaction2(ctx, arg1, arg2) { console.info('transaction2', arg1, arg2); } Section 4: Package, Install and Instantiate our Smart Contract In this section, we will package the smart contract we just created and then install and instantiate it onto our local Hyperledger Fabric network. We will realize how easy this is very soon. 1. In order to successfully install and instantiate a smart contract, we first need to package our contract up. We can do this by navigating to the IBP Extension (the block outline within our VSCode). 2. Once we are in the IBP extension, repeat the steps from section 2, step 1 by clicking on the gear in the bottom left and then selecting Command Palette . When it asks us for a command to run, type this in below and press enter IBM Blockchain Platform: Package a Smart Contract Project 3. Then the extension will create a package (a .cds file) with your smart contract name and then set its version to 0.0.1 - in this case mycontract@0.0.1 within the Smart Contract Packages side panel. 4. Now that we have our smart contract packaged up, untoggle the Smart Contracts option from within the Local Fabric Ops panel. There you will have the option to install and instantiate our smart contract package. Since we all are very smart, we know that we have to install before instantiating. So do that by clicking on + Install . 5. Installing chaincode is a peer level operation, so we will get a pop-up message asking which peer to install the chaincode on. Simply click on the peer it gives us, in this case it is peer0.org1.example.com . Then it will ask what to install. We will want to install mycontract@0.0.1 onto that peer. Press enter to begin this operation Peer: peer0.org1.example.com Package: mycontract@0.0.1 6. Once we have it installed, we see the smart contract underneath the Installed section of the Local Fabric Ops panel. Make sure this is there before continuing. 7. To activate the chaincode on the peer, we have to instantiate the chaincode. To do this, simply click on the + Instantiate underneath the Instantiated option. Since instantiation is a channel operation, it will ask what channel to instantiate the chaincode on. You will want to instantiate on mychannel and then the mycontract@0.0.1 as the smart contract. Then it will ask what function we want to pass through. We want to enter instantiate here. Then for the last popup message, simply just press enter and it will begin to instantiate Channel: mychannel Package: mycontract@0.0.1 # It should say installed to the right of the package Function: instantiate 8. We will know if we successfully instantiated the smart contract when it says so underneath the Instantiated section in the Local Fabric Ops panel. Section 5: Unit Test our Smart Contract In this section, we will test our smart contract to make sure the transactions will work the way they should. This test does not commit any data to the ledger, but rather tests to make sure they work in general. You can say this is a way to make sure your code is working the way you want it to. Later, we will test our transactions that commit data to the ledger. 1. Jump back up to our Explorer perspective at the top left of VSCode. From there naviagate to mycontract/test/my-contract.js and actually click on the my-contract.js file to open it in our VSCode. 2. Once you have the file open, right click on my-contract.js and then select Open in Terminal - this will open this file path directly to our terminal at the bottom of our VSCode 3. From there you will see your terminal go directly to our test folder. We can verify it by entering pwd and observing that we are in the path from where we created our smart contract folder back in section 2. Equally, we can do a ls -l command to verify that we see our my-contract.js file in there. 4. To test our smart contract code, simply enter npm test below from the terminal in VSCode tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/test$ npm test 5. From there, we will test our smart contract. If we are successful, we will see the following messages below #instantiate instantiate \u2713 should work #transaction1 transaction1 hello \u2713 should work #transaction2 transaction2 hello world \u2713 should work 3 passing (25ms) Section 6: Submit Transactions In this section we will actually submit transactions after knowing that our smart contract is good to go! 1. Enter the following command below to see all of our Docker containers running. Please do this from the command line in VSCode tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/test$ docker ps -a You should see 5 containers running: peer, cerificate authority, orderer, couchdb and the chaincode container 2. To see the logs of our chaincode container enter the following commmand from your terminal in VSCode. NOTE: scroll to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/test$ docker logs -f fabricvscodelocalfabric-peer0.org1.example.com-mycontract-0.0.1 NOTE: The docker smart contract container name will be different if you named your smart contract something other than mycontract . 3. Navigate to the IBP Extension where we will utilize the third panel on the left - called Fabric Gateways 4. From here, click on Admin@org1.example.com and you will see all the channels in our network, in this case it is just mychannel . Untoggle on mychannel and then mycontract@0.0.1 to see all of our possible transactions: instantiate, transaction1, transaction2 5. Once you have untoggled all the required things, right click on transaction1 and select Submit Transaction . Again there will be a popup in the top middle of VSCode. When it asks for an argument, type in Hello and press enter Arguments: \"Hello\" 6. Once the transaction has been submitted, you should see the transaction coming through the chaincode container. 7. Equally, you could check the logs of your peer by entering the following command below within VSCode. I'm grep-ing these logs because there is a lot of output due to the signatures and messages a transaction sends, but I'm just wanting to see all the blocks tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/test$ docker logs -f fabricvscodelocalfabric_peer0.org1.example.com | grep block 2019-02-21 20:02:09.209 UTC [endorser] callChaincode - INFO 093 [mychannel][c55f59cc] Entry chaincode: name:\"mycontract\" 2019-02-21 20:02:09.213 UTC [endorser] callChaincode - INFO 094 [mychannel][c55f59cc] Exit chaincode: name:\"mycontract\" (4ms) 2019-02-21 20:02:09.213 UTC [comm.grpc.server] 1 - INFO 095 unary call completed {\"grpc.start_time\": \"2019-02-21T20:02:09.207Z\", \"grpc.service\": \"protos.Endorser\", \"grpc.method\": \"ProcessProposal\", \"grpc.peer_address\": \"172.18.0.1:39474\", \"grpc.code\": \"OK\", \"grpc.call_duration\": \"6.3366ms\"} 2019-02-21 20:02:09.945 UTC [endorser] callChaincode - INFO 096 [mychannel][4bb0a014] Entry chaincode: name:\"mycontract\" 2019-02-21 20:02:09.948 UTC [endorser] callChaincode - INFO 097 [mychannel][4bb0a014] Exit chaincode: name:\"mycontract\" (3ms) 2019-02-21 20:02:09.949 UTC [comm.grpc.server] 1 - INFO 098 unary call completed {\"grpc.start_time\": \"2019-02-21T20:02:09.944Z\", \"grpc.service\": \"protos.Endorser\", \"grpc.method\": \"ProcessProposal\", \"grpc.peer_address\": \"172.18.0.1:39474\", \"grpc.code\": \"OK\", \"grpc.call_duration\": \"4.6952ms\"} 2019-02-21 20:09:52.334 UTC [endorser] callChaincode - INFO 099 [mychannel][3015cddc] Entry chaincode: name:\"mycontract\" 2019-02-21 20:09:52.340 UTC [endorser] callChaincode - INFO 09a [mychannel][3015cddc] Exit chaincode: name:\"mycontract\" (6ms) 2019-02-21 20:09:52.340 UTC [comm.grpc.server] 1 - INFO 09b unary call completed {\"grpc.start_time\": \"2019-02-21T20:09:52.333Z\", \"grpc.service\": \"protos.Endorser\", \"grpc.method\": \"ProcessProposal\", \"grpc.peer_address\": \"172.18.0.1:39474\", \"grpc.code\": \"OK\", \"grpc.call_duration\": \"7.2863ms\"} 2019-02-21 20:09:54.435 UTC [gossip.privdata] StoreBlock - INFO 09c [mychannel] Received block [2] from buffer 2019-02-21 20:09:54.437 UTC [committer.txvalidator] Validate - INFO 09d [mychannel] Validated block [2] in 1ms 2019-02-21 20:09:54.698 UTC [kvledger] CommitWithPvtData - INFO 09e [mychannel] Committed block [2] with 1 transaction(s) in 260ms (state_validation=69ms block_commit=92ms state_commit=76ms) Can you guess what Block: #1 was? 8. Feel free to pass in other transactions if you would like! Section 7: Generate Smart Contract Test Client In this section, we will generate a test client for our smart contract as well. This test is different from the unit tests in section 5 due to the fact that we will actually commit a transaction to the ledger with data. 1. From the IBP Extension and within the Fabric Gateways panel, right click on the smart contract - in this case mycontract@0.0.1 . Then click on Generate Smart Contract Tests . 2. When another pop-up opens, select JavaScript as the smart contract language. In VSCode you will see a new file open again. In my case it is called MyContract-mycontract@0.0.1.test.js SmartContract Language: JavaScript File Name: MyContract-mycontract@0.0.1.test.js NOTE: If we see a little caution box appear in the bottom, right click on the X to close that message. That little booger of a message is as annoying as someone typing @here on a SLACK channel 3. Within that new file, scroll down to where you see transaction1 , in my case it is on line 71, but that could be different for you. A couple of lines down (on 83 for me) you'll see ( NOTE: I realize the picture differs, but with each release of the IBM Blockchain extension, they might add or delete lines with certain files.) const args = ['']; . Now, place some text between those two apostrophes. See below to get an example const args = ['This is test transaction']; We could even do this if we wanted too const args = [\"I'm going to brag to my friends about my blockchain skillz and not my spelling skills\"]; 4. Before we do anything further, please save (control + s) this file. Now that we have data to put onto the ledger, click on Run Test to submit the transaction and we should see this in the terminal. The Run Test button can be found by placing your cursor just above the transaction1 code. The output below will occur within your VSCode terminal tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract$ cd /home/tecadmin/Desktop/mycontract tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract$ node_modules/.bin/mocha functionalTests/MyContract-mycontract@0.0.1.test.js --grep=\"transaction1\" MyContract-mycontract@0.0.1 2019-02-21T20:44:28.345Z - info: [TransactionEventHandler]: _strategySuccess: strategy success for transaction \"975a2eaf65a3d6866aeae6e102226c00fefa99395b660869c5fb30d0557e19e2\" \u2713 transaction1 (2453ms) 1 passing (3s) 5. Again, we can check the logs of our chaincode container within your VSCode terminal. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract$ docker logs -f fabricvscodelocalfabric-peer0.org1.example.com-mycontract-0.0.1 mycontract@0.0.1 start /usr/local/src fabric-chaincode-node start \"--peer.address\" \"peer0.org1.example.com:7052\" (node:18) DeprecationWarning: grpc.load: Use the @grpc/proto-loader module with grpc.loadPackageDefinition instead Command succeeded instantiate transaction1 Hello transaction1 6. If we wanted to check the logs of the peer, we can do that as well within your VSCode terminal. You'll see similar output as what is below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract$ docker logs -f fabricvscodelocalfabric_peer0.org1.example.com | grep block 2019-02-21 20:29:41.609 UTC [endorser] callChaincode - INFO 09f [mychannel][40cef608] Entry chaincode: name:\"mycontract\" 2019-02-21 20:29:41.615 UTC [endorser] callChaincode - INFO 0a0 [mychannel][40cef608] Exit chaincode: name:\"mycontract\" (7ms) 2019-02-21 20:29:41.616 UTC [comm.grpc.server] 1 - INFO 0a1 unary call completed {\"grpc.start_time\": \"2019-02-21T20:29:41.607Z\", \"grpc.service\": \"protos.Endorser\", \"grpc.method\": \"ProcessProposal\", \"grpc.peer_address\": \"172.18.0.1:39474\", \"grpc.code\": \"OK\", \"grpc.call_duration\": \"8.9484ms\"} 2019-02-21 20:44:16.003 UTC [endorser] callChaincode - INFO 0a2 [mychannel][34444572] Entry chaincode: name:\"cscc\" 2019-02-21 20:44:16.005 UTC [endorser] callChaincode - INFO 0a3 [mychannel][34444572] Exit chaincode: name:\"cscc\" (1ms) 2019-02-21 20:44:16.005 UTC [comm.grpc.server] 1 - INFO 0a4 unary call completed {\"grpc.start_time\": \"2019-02-21T20:44:16.003Z\", \"grpc.service\": \"protos.Endorser\", \"grpc.method\": \"ProcessProposal\", \"grpc.peer_address\": \"172.18.0.1:39632\", \"grpc.code\": \"OK\", \"grpc.call_duration\": \"1.9887ms\"} 2019-02-21 20:44:16.021 UTC [endorser] callChaincode - INFO 0a5 [mychannel][975a2eaf] Entry chaincode: name:\"mycontract\" 2019-02-21 20:44:16.046 UTC [endorser] callChaincode - INFO 0a6 [mychannel][975a2eaf] Exit chaincode: name:\"mycontract\" (25ms) 2019-02-21 20:44:16.046 UTC [comm.grpc.server] 1 - INFO 0a7 unary call completed {\"grpc.start_time\": \"2019-02-21T20:44:16.02Z\", \"grpc.service\": \"protos.Endorser\", \"grpc.method\": \"ProcessProposal\", \"grpc.peer_address\": \"172.18.0.1:39632\", \"grpc.code\": \"OK\", \"grpc.call_duration\": \"26.922ms\"} 2019-02-21 20:44:18.151 UTC [gossip.privdata] StoreBlock - INFO 0a8 [mychannel] Received block [3] from buffer 2019-02-21 20:44:18.154 UTC [committer.txvalidator] Validate - INFO 0a9 [mychannel] Validated block [3] in 2ms 2019-02-21 20:44:18.418 UTC [kvledger] CommitWithPvtData - INFO 0aa [mychannel] Committed block [3] with 1 transaction(s) in 264ms (state_validation=66ms block_commit=93ms state_commit=85ms) 7. To prepare for Part 2: Commercial Paper Tutorial close out of all the tabs in VSCode and exit all log messages in your terminal by pressing control + c . Additionally, you can switch back to the Explorer tab and close the mycontract folder by right clicking on it and selecting Remove Folder from Workplace .","title":"Part 1"},{"location":"vscode-part1/#part-1-vscode-and-the-ibm-blockchain-extension","text":"","title":"Part 1: VSCode and the IBM Blockchain Extension"},{"location":"vscode-part1/#section-1-overview","text":"In this part of the lab, we will guide you through the steps for generating, installing and instantiating a smart contract and then testing that smart contract to verify that it works. Before all of that, we will have you start up the local Hyperledger Fabric network so that we can build our smart contract on top of it. In this lab, we have you deploy to a local network that is running on your laptop, but you can also connect the IBM Blockchain Platform VSCode extension to either your IBM Blockchain Platform network running in the cloud or your IBM Blockchain Platform on IBM Cloud Private network on-premises. Below is a breakdown of Part 1 of our lab Install and Start up a Blockchain Network: We must make sure that all levels of software (docker, node, npm, docker-compose and yo) are at the correct level before we start building our smart contract. Then, we will install the IBM Blockchain Platform extension that will allow us to create and develop our smart contract. Once we have done that, we will then start up the Hyperledger Fabric network, which will consist of a certificate authority (CA), orderer (solo - meant for dev/test), couchdb, ccenv (chaincode environment), and most importantly our peer. Create our Smart Contract: Now that we have a running Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network, we will create our smart contract. The smart contract will be very basic in nature, but we will explain what the contract is trying to accomplish before we go through some of the unique features that the extension can do for us and our smart contract. Package, Install and Instantiate our Smart Contract: Since we have an understanding of how our smart contract works, we will need to install (peer level command) it on our peer and then instantiate (channel level command) the installed smart contract on the channel. Once we have instantiated the smart contract, we will be able to submit transactions. Unit Test our Smart Contract: Once we have an instantiated smart contract on our channel, we will then test out the code to make sure that the contract will actually work when we submit transactions. This checks all the files within our smart contract and simulates all of our transactions. We will know we are cooking with gas when our test comes back successful. This test feature does not actually commit anything to the ledger or world state, but the last section of part 1 of this lab will submit tests that will commit data to the ledger. We will go into detail once we get to that point. Submit Transactions: What fun is it to have a working smart contract and have it instantiated across the channel, if we can't submit transactions? In this section, we will actually submit transactions from the UI of VSCode. We will see data get committed to the ledger. Generate Smart Contract Test Client: In the final section of part 1, we will generate a test file that will test our smart contract, while submitting transactions to the ledger. We will view the docker logs of our running smart contract and see the transactions being added to the logs as well as the ledger.","title":"Section 1: Overview"},{"location":"vscode-part1/#section-2-install-and-start-up-a-blockchain-network","text":"NOTE: For Part 1 of our lab, we will be using the terminal within VSCode. Do not execute the commands within the actual terminal application. You can enter them from the terminal application, but the instructions below will all be within the VSCode terminal. Part 2 of this lab, you will use the terminal application. 1. Open up your teminal and type in the following commands below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~$ node -v # We want Node to be v8.x or higher v8.11.3 tecadmin@ubuntubase:~$ npm -v # We want NPM to be v5.x or higher 5.6.0 tecadmin@ubuntubase:~$ yo --version # We want yo to be v2.x or higher 2.0.5 tecadmin@ubuntubase:~$ docker --version # We want Docker to be v17.06.2-ce or higher Docker version 17.06.2-ce, build cec0b72 tecadmin@ubuntubase:~$ docker-compose --version # We want Docker Compose to be v1.14.0 or higher docker-compose version 1.14.0, build c7bdf9e If you get a version that doesn't support our qualifications, raise your hand and tell the instructor. 2. From the same command line, enter the following command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~$ code This will start Visual Studio Code (VSCode) 3. From the user interface (UI) of VSCode, click on the 4th item down. This will allow you to search for available extensions to install and work from 4. In the search bar, type in blockchain and that should populate all the available extensions that deal with blockchain. The top choice should be the IBM Blockchain Platform extension. I promise we didn't manipulate the algothrim to make it the top choice! If you see the IBM Blockchain Platform (IBP) extension, please click on install to install the extension. 5. Once you have successfully installed the extension, you should see an outline of a block just below the extensions button (approximately, the 6th button in VSCode). Go ahead and click on that button. Once you do, you'll be welcomed with the IBM Blockchain Platform VSCode Homepage with the sides being divided into thirds. The IBM Blockchain Extension perspective is broken into thirds on the left. It is broken into Smart Contract Packages , Local Fabric Ops and Fabric Gateways . Smart Contract Packages is the home for all of our smart contracts that are packaged into .cds files. It packages these smart contracts based on the files that are in the Editor perspective. Now, just because there are packages here doesn't mean that the smart contract is actually installed and instantiated on the channel. To do that we can go to the Local Fabric Ops pane. The Local Fabric Ops is a place where we can quickly gather and see all of our network information. If you untoggle the Smart Contracts flag, we can see all the contracts that are installed and instantiated. We can install and instantiate smart contracts from the Local Fabric Ops field. The Channel field shows all of the channels that are in our blockchain network. By default when we do Start Fabric Runtime in the next command, we'll join a channel called mychannel . The Nodes field shows us all of the peers that are in our network. In the Organizations field, we'll see all the organizations that are in the network. You can have an organization with no peers (nodes - in this case), but you can't have a peer without an organization. An organization can have many peers. The last pane, Fabric Gateway , allows you to connect to a Hyperledger Fabric instance by an identity. In our case, it will be the Admin@org1.example.com of our local Fabric network. In Part 2 of this lab, we will create an identity and submit transactions from this new identity. 6. Hover your mouse over the Local Fabric Ops panel and we'll see three dots - ... - and click on those dots. We'll be presented with two options. Start Fabric Runtime and Teardown Fabric Runtime are those two options. We will want to click on Start Fabric Runtime in this case. This will start our local Hyperledger Fabric network. It will stand up a peer, certificate authority, orderer and a couchdb container. In addition to standing up these containers, it will join our peer to a channel called mychannel . The difference between Start Fabric Runtime and Teardown Fabric Runtime might be obvious, but Start Fabric Runtime grabs all of the Hyperledger Fabric images and starts them as containers. In addition, it builds the crypto material (certificates, public and private keys) and creates and joins a sample channel called mychannel . The other option, Teardown Fabric Runtime basically cleans up the network and removes all of the containers that Start Fabric Runtime builds. It does leave the Start Fabric Runtime docker images. To do a full cleanup, we will need to manually remove those images and containers. 7. How do we know if we have a successful blockchain network up and running? I'm glad you asked! We will see messages flooding the Output panel. We will want to see a message that resembles the one below [2/20/2019 7:26:54 PM] [INFO] 2019-02-21 00:26:34.756 UTC [cli.common] readBlock - INFO 002 Received block: 0 [2/20/2019 7:26:54 PM] [INFO] 2019-02-21 00:26:34.930 UTC [channelCmd] InitCmdFactory - INFO 001 Endorser and orderer connections initialized [2/20/2019 7:26:55 PM] [INFO] 2019-02-21 00:26:35.458 UTC [channelCmd] executeJoin - INFO 002 Successfully submitted proposal to join channel 8.

We can do that by clicking on the gear icon in the bottom left and then clicking on Command Palette. This will give us the option to do a series of commands, some that are VSCode-related and some that are IBM Blockchain Platform-related. 2. You will notice a series of commands pop up. Go ahead and enter this command below into the search bar IBM Blockchain Platform: Create Smart Contract Project This command will generate a skeleton smart contract for us. We will walk through all that it generates in a second. 3. We might get a message that says Can this extension install missing npm packages before proceeding? Select yes if that message comes up. What it is installing is generator-fabric which is actually the generator that creates our skeleton smart contract. 4. We'll then get a message that says Chose smart contract language (esc to cancel) Choose JavaScript as our smart contract language of choice 5. Then will pop open a folder directory. Since we are starting a new project, let's create a new folder for our smart contract. We can call this folder mycontract . Then click on open to allow VSCode to generate our smart contract in that folder. 6. We will get another pop-up asking Choose how to open your new project We'll want to select Add to workplace to add it to our VSCode 7. So we have created our smart contract, but gosh darnit, where is it? Well, let's click on the Explorer in the top left. It's the first botton on our left side panel 8. From the Explorer page, we will see all the open tabs we have open in VSCode and then all the smart contracts we created in our workspace, which should only be our [mycontract]{.title-ref}. 9.

The instantiate transaction expects an instantiate argument when actually instantiating this smart contract. You can see that below. In fact, we will instantiate in the next section async instantiate(ctx) { console.info('instantiate'); } async transaction1(ctx, arg1) { console.info('transaction1', arg1); } async transaction2(ctx, arg1, arg2) { console.info('transaction2', arg1, arg2); }","title":"Section 3: Create our Smart Contract"},{"location":"vscode-part1/#section-4-package-install-and-instantiate-our-smart-contract","text":"In this section, we will package the smart contract we just created and then install and instantiate it onto our local Hyperledger Fabric network. We will realize how easy this is very soon. 1. In order to successfully install and instantiate a smart contract, we first need to package our contract up. We can do this by navigating to the IBP Extension (the block outline within our VSCode). 2. Once we are in the IBP extension, repeat the steps from section 2, step 1 by clicking on the gear in the bottom left and then selecting Command Palette . When it asks us for a command to run, type this in below and press enter IBM Blockchain Platform: Package a Smart Contract Project 3. Then the extension will create a package (a .cds file) with your smart contract name and then set its version to 0.0.1 - in this case mycontract@0.0.1 within the Smart Contract Packages side panel. 4. Now that we have our smart contract packaged up, untoggle the Smart Contracts option from within the Local Fabric Ops panel. There you will have the option to install and instantiate our smart contract package. Since we all are very smart, we know that we have to install before instantiating. So do that by clicking on + Install . 5. Installing chaincode is a peer level operation, so we will get a pop-up message asking which peer to install the chaincode on. Simply click on the peer it gives us, in this case it is peer0.org1.example.com . Then it will ask what to install. We will want to install mycontract@0.0.1 onto that peer. Press enter to begin this operation Peer: peer0.org1.example.com Package: mycontract@0.0.1 6. Once we have it installed, we see the smart contract underneath the Installed section of the Local Fabric Ops panel. Make sure this is there before continuing. 7. To activate the chaincode on the peer, we have to instantiate the chaincode. To do this, simply click on the + Instantiate underneath the Instantiated option. Since instantiation is a channel operation, it will ask what channel to instantiate the chaincode on. You will want to instantiate on mychannel and then the mycontract@0.0.1 as the smart contract. Then it will ask what function we want to pass through. We want to enter instantiate here. Then for the last popup message, simply just press enter and it will begin to instantiate Channel: mychannel Package: mycontract@0.0.1 # It should say installed to the right of the package Function: instantiate 8. We will know if we successfully instantiated the smart contract when it says so underneath the Instantiated section in the Local Fabric Ops panel.","title":"Section 4: Package, Install and Instantiate our Smart Contract"},{"location":"vscode-part1/#section-5-unit-test-our-smart-contract","text":"In this section, we will test our smart contract to make sure the transactions will work the way they should.

Later, we will test our transactions that commit data to the ledger. 1. Jump back up to our Explorer perspective at the top left of VSCode. From there naviagate to mycontract/test/my-contract.js and actually click on the my-contract.js file to open it in our VSCode. 2. Once you have the file open, right click on my-contract.js and then select Open in Terminal - this will open this file path directly to our terminal at the bottom of our VSCode 3. From there you will see your terminal go directly to our test folder. We can verify it by entering pwd and observing that we are in the path from where we created our smart contract folder back in section 2. Equally, we can do a ls -l command to verify that we see our my-contract.js file in there. 4. To test our smart contract code, simply enter npm test below from the terminal in VSCode tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/test$ npm test 5. From there, we will test our smart contract.

From here, click on Admin@org1.example.com and you will see all the channels in our network, in this case it is just mychannel . Untoggle on mychannel and then mycontract@0.0.1 to see all of our possible transactions: instantiate, transaction1, transaction2 5. Once you have untoggled all the required things, right click on transaction1 and select Submit Transaction . Again there will be a popup in the top middle of VSCode. When it asks for an argument, type in Hello and press enter Arguments: \"Hello\" 6. Once the transaction has been submitted, you should see the transaction coming through the chaincode container. 7. Equally, you could check the logs of your peer by entering the following command below within VSCode.

Commercial paper itself is a type of unsecured lending in the form of a \"promissory note\". The papers are normally issued by large corporations to raise funds to meet short-term financial obligations at a fixed rate of interest. Once issued at a fixed price, for a fixed term, another company or bank will purchase them at a discount to the face value and when the term is up, they will be redeemed for their face value. As an example, if a paper was issued at a face value of 10M USD for a 6-month term at 2% interest then it could be bought for 9.8M USD (10M -- 2%) by another company or bank who are happy to bear the risk that the issuer will not default. Once the term is up, then the paper could be redeemed or sold back to the issuer for their full face value of 10M USD. Between buying and redemption, the paper can be bought or sold between different parties on a commercial paper market. These three key steps of issue, buy and redeem are the main transactions in a simplified commercial paper marketplace, which we will mirror in our lab. We will see a commercial paper issued by a company called MagnetoCorp and once issued on the commercial paper blockchain network, another company called DigiBank will first buy the paper and then redeem it. You'll act as a developer, end user, and administrator, each in different organizations, performing the following steps designed to help you understand what it's like to collaborate as two different organizations working independently, but according to mutually agreed rules in a Hyperledger Fabric network. Below is an image of our PaperNet network. For our lab, we will create Isabella who is with MagnetoCorp. Additionally, we will create Balaji who is with DigiBank. Isabella will issue a paper for the network. The paper will have an ID number, when it was issued, the maturity date, and the face value ($). Balaji, from DigiBank, will then buy the paper and then eventually redeem it. Below is the full breakdown of Part 2 of this lab: Setting the Stage: Based off of Part 1, we have started a blockchain network, created a smart contract, created and run tests and then submitted transactions. For Part 2, we need to create a couple more docker containers that will set us up for success for the rest of the lab. One of these containers will just monitor the docker network we are operating in. If you have no idea what a docker network is, I will explain later on. The other continer is fabric-tools , but it is named cliMagnetoCorp which will be how we install and instantiate the first time. Install and Instantiate Smart Contract: Now that we have those new docker containers up and running, we will enter our cliMagnetoCorp container and install and instantiate our smart contract. Since we are connected to the same running local Hyperledger Fabric network, we will see the smart contract show up in VSCode. Issue Identities: In this section, we will issue two identites. One is an end-user named Isabella with MagnetoCorp . She will invoke a transaction that will issue a paper. Then we will issue an identity for DigiBank named Balaji . Balaji will act as the adminstrator for Digibank and will buy and redeem the paper that Isabella issued. Balaji is important in this lab, as we will add a Fabric Gateway connection to connect to his perspective of the network. Upgrade Smart Contract: This section is the longest of the entire lab, but it really exemplifies the power of VSCode and the IBM Blockchain Platform extension. We will update our smart contract code to include one more transaction called getPaper . This transaction will allow us to see the current status of the paper, like who knows it, what is its status and how much is it worth. In addition to modifiying the code, we will update our smart contract so that the network is aware of the new smart contract. Submit Transactions: Now that we have added a transaction to our smart contract, we will then submit various transactions from many different places and perspectives. For example, we will issue a transaction from the command line interface as well as the VSCode user interface. We will also issue another paper from Isabella's perspective and then invoke a series of transactions to buy and redeem the paper from Balaji. Lab Cleanup: This is the most bittersweet part of the entire lab. It means the lab is over and we have to clean up. If you have kids (I don't), I'd imagine their faces are sad and full of despair when you (the guardian) tell them to clean up their mess. I'd also like to imagine your face is making a similar expression right now. It's okay, more fun is going to be had soon - very soon! Section 2: Setting the Stage NOTE: There are two terminals we can operate in - the actual terminal application and the terminal found in VSCode. Unless I explicitly say, only use the terminal application - meaning do not use the terminal in VSCode. On the chance that we will use the terminal in VSCode, I will specify that. 1. Open your terminal and navigate to your Desktop directory and then clone the fabric-samples github repository tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract$ ls -l total 0 drwxr-xr-x 16 tecadmin tecadmin 512 Feb 22 12:34 mycontract tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract$ git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples.git Cloning into 'fabric-samples'... remote: Enumerating objects: 85, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (85/85), done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (71/71), done. remote: Total 2658 (delta 26), reused 71 (delta 13), pack-reused 2573 Receiving objects: 100% (2658/2658), 927.08 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.

We need to know the Docker network that we are currently in so that we can modify some scripts, that will then create more Docker containers for us to use. Enter the command below to see all of our Docker networks tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract$ docker network list NETWORK ID NAME DRIVER SCOPE ad2e1a3e2fc2 bridge bridge local 35837170ae5b fabricvscodelocalfabric_basic bridge local c5e0411b0d34 host host local 42ffa501f2f9 none null local 3. The network we are in is called fabricvscodelocalfabric_basic and we can verify that by doing the following command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract$ docker network inspect fabricvscodelocalfabric_basic That command will show you all the containers running in this network. In a nutshell, docker networks are natural ways to isolate containers from other containers or other networks. Having containers within a network allows them to immediately communicate with other containers in the network. 4. Within VSCode, go to the Editor perspective and click on File and select Add Folder to Workplace.. - This will allow us to work from an Untitled Workplace , but have the fabric-samples folder in there. 5. Within VSCode, navigate to the folder below within MagnetoCorp fabric-samples - commercial paper - organizations - magenetocorp - configuration - cli You should see two files in there. One named docker-compose-yml and another named monitordocker.sh 6. Within the docker-compose.yml file, replace the net_basic with fabricvscodelocalfabric_basic on line 11 and save your file by pressing control + s 7. Now within the monitordocker.sh file, replace basicnetwork_basic with fabricvscodelocalfabric_basic on line 9 and again save by pressing control + s 8. Now from the terminal navigate to the cli directory within MagnetoCorp. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract$ cd fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli/ tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli/$ ls -l total 16 -rw-r--r-- 1 tecadmin tecadmin 1168 Feb 22 12:41 docker-compose.yml -rwxr-xr-x 1 tecadmin tecadmin 751 Feb 22 12:44 monitordocker.sh 9. Now that we have updated these files to represent the correct Docker network, go ahead run the monitordocker file with the name of our Docker network. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli/$ ./monitordocker.sh fabricvscodelocalfabric_basic This command will pull down another container that just monitors all of the docker log output from the fabricvscodelocalfabric_basic network. I'm going off a hunch, but I think that's why the file is called monitordocker.sh . We will see more messages coming very soon. 10. Since this terminal is occupied with log messages, let's open another terminal tab. We can open a new tab by clicking on File and then selecting New Tab 11. When you opened a new tab, you should have been taken to the same file path that you were in on the previous tab. Now that we have a command line ready, go ahead and enter the command below that will create a cliMagnetoCorp container for our docker network to use. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli/$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d cliMagnetoCorp . . # We'll see docker messages . Status: Downloaded newer image for hyperledger/fabric-tools:latest Creating cliMagnetoCorp ... Creating cliMagnetoCorp ... done When we first install the smart contract, we will go through the cliMagnetoCorp container, which is our Administrator Console. This will allow use to use Fabric peer commands. Conveniently, the cliMagnetoCorp container is the hyperledger/fabric-tools image. 12. We can also do a docker ps -a command to see all of our docker containers. We should see two new containers - cliMagnetoCorp and logspout 13. Equally, we could do docker network inspect fabricvscodelocalfabric_basic to see all of our containers together in one network - and no, not in a blockchain network. They are, however, the components that make up our local blockchain network :) Section 3: Install and Instantiate Smart Contract Before we actually install the commercial paper smart contract, let's actually open the file to see what the smart contract is trying to do. 1. From your explorer perspective, navigate from the fabric-samples folder to the contract folder of MagnetoCorp fabric-samples - commercial-paper - organization - magnetocorp - contract Within the lib folder, you'll see 3 javascript (.js) files in there. Click on the papercontract.js file, which will open it that file within VSCode Let's dissect our papercontract.js file as it is our smart contract. We will only go over the issue transaction, but the other transactions follow pretty closely to this one Below, these 2 lines of code brings into scope two key Hyperledger Fabric classes that will be used extensively by the smart contract -- Contract and Context // Fabric smart contract classes const { Contract, Context } = require('fabric-contract-api'); Below, we define the smart contract class CommercialPaperContract based on the built-in Fabric Contract class. The methods which implement the key transactions to issue, buy and redeem commercial paper are defined within this class /** * Define commercial paper smart contract by extending Fabric Contract class * */ class CommercialPaperContract extends Contract { Below, this method defines the commercial paper issue transaction for commercial paper blockchain network. The parameters that are passed to this method will be used to create the new commercial paper. Locate and examine the buy and redeem transactions within the smart contract /** * Issue commercial paper * * @param {Context} ctx the transaction context * @param {String} issuer commercial paper issuer * @param {Integer} paperNumber paper number for this issuer * @param {String} issueDateTime paper issue date * @param {String} maturityDateTime paper maturity date * @param {Integer} faceValue face value of paper */ async issue(ctx, issuer, paperNumber, issueDateTime, maturityDateTime, faceValue) { Within the issue transaction, this statement creates a new commercial paper in memory using the CommercialPaper class with the supplied transaction inputs. Examine the buy and redeem transactions to see how they similarly use this class below // create an instance of the paper let paper = CommercialPaper.createInstance(issuer, paperNumber, issueDateTime, maturityDateTime, faceValue); Below, this statement adds the new commercial paper to the ledger using ctx.paperList, an instance of a PaperList class that was created when the smart contract context CommercialPaperContext was initialized. Again, examine the buy and redeem methods to see how they use this class // Add the paper to the list of all similar commercial papers in the ledger world state await ctx.paperList.addPaper(paper); Below you will find that this statement returns a binary buffer as response from the issue transaction for processing by the caller of the smart contract // Must return a serialized paper to caller of smart contract return paper.toBuffer(); 2. Now that we have an understanding of the smart contract, let's actually install it on our peer through our terminal. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli/$ docker exec cliMagnetoCorp peer chaincode install -n papercontract -v 0 -p /opt/gopath/src/github.com/contract -l node 2019-02-22 17:48:23.721 UTC [chaincodeCmd] checkChaincodeCmdParams - INFO 001 Using default escc 2019-02-22 17:48:23.721 UTC [chaincodeCmd] checkChaincodeCmdParams - INFO 002 Using default vscc 2019-02-22 17:48:23.862 UTC [chaincodeCmd] install - INFO 003 Installed remotely response: status:200 payload:\"OK\" A message saying 200 is a great sign to see. If you notice, we are not in the contract folder of our command line interface. Instead, we are entering the cliMagnetoCorp docker container with docker exec cliMagnetoCorp and navigating to the /opt/gopath/src/github.com/contract file path within our container to grab the files we need to install the smart contract. The -n papercontract flag names our smart contract papercontract . The -v 0 gives our smart contract a version of 0. Finally, the -l node tells us that the language of our smart contract is nodejs. The picture below goes into detail, visually, as to how we are actually installing a copy of the commercial paper smart contract on our peer. 3. Since our network is connected to our VSCode instance, you can refresh the Local Fabric Ops panel in VSCode under the IBM Blockchain extension. The refresh button is revealed when you hover your mouse over the Local Fabric Ops panel 4. Since we have installed the smart contract, we should actually make it active by instantiating it. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli/$ docker exec cliMagnetoCorp peer chaincode instantiate -n papercontract -v 0 -l node -c '{\"Args\":[\"org.papernet.commercialpaper:instantiate\"]}' -C mychannel -P \"\" 2019-02-22 17:50:34.673 UTC [chaincodeCmd] InitCmdFactory - INFO 001 Retrieved channel (mychannel) orderer endpoint: orderer.example.com:7050 2019-02-22 17:50:34.675 UTC [chaincodeCmd] checkChaincodeCmdParams - INFO 002 Using default escc 2019-02-22 17:50:34.675 UTC [chaincodeCmd] checkChaincodeCmdParams - INFO 003 Using default vscc tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli/$ As you can see in the image below, we are instantiating a copy of the commercial paper smart contract on our MagnetoCorp peer. Similar to the installation of the smart contract, the instantiation goes into the cliMagnetoCorp container. After successfully instantiating the smart contract, there will be a commercial paper smart contract docker image and container. 5. You will know our instantiate command worked when we simply get our command prompt back. You can really verify it worked by going back to the VSCode and refreshing the Local Fabric Ops panel and you should see it under the instantiate section. Section 4: Issue Identities Now that we have a ready-to-use smart contract, let's issue some identities so that those identities can invoke and query transactions. 1. You should be within the cli folder of the MagnetoCorp folder. You can confirm this by issuing the command below. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli/$ pwd /Users/home/Desktop/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli This is a good sign. Issue the following command below to get to the application folder within MagnetoCorp. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli/$ cd ../../application/ tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/application$ 2. From the Explorer perspective within VSCode, navigate to the same folder. That is, the application folder within MagnetoCorp . You should see 4 files in there: .eslintrc.js, addToWallet.js, issue.js , and package.json 3. Click on issue.js , which will open the file within VSCode. Let's discuss what the file is trying to do. Below we bring in two key Hyperledger Fabric SDK classes into scope -- Wallet and Gateway . Because Isabella's X.509 certificate is in the local file system, the application uses FileSystemWallet // Bring key classes into scope, most importantly Fabric SDK network class const { FileSystemWallet, Gateway } = require('fabric-network'); Below, this statement identifies that the application will use Isabella's wallet when it connects to the blockchain network channel. The application will select a particular identity within Isabella's wallet. (The wallet must have been loaded with Isabella's X.509 certificate -- that's what addToWallet.js does.) // A wallet stores a collection of identities for use const wallet = new FileSystemWallet('../identity/user/isabella/wallet'); This line of code, below, connects to the network using the gateway identified by connectionProfile , using the identity referred to in ConnectionOptions . See how ../gateway/networkConnection.yaml and User1@org1.example.com are used for these values respectively // Connect to gateway using application specified parameters await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, connectionOptions); Below in the couple lines of code, connects the application to the network channel mychannel , where the papercontract was previously instantiated. If you had a different channel name, you would have to modify this line of code // Access commercial paper network const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel'); Below, this statement gives the application addressability to the smart contract defined by the namespace org.papernet.commercialpaper within papercontract. Once an application has issued getContract, it can submit any transaction implemented within it // Get addressability to commercial paper contract const contract = await network.getContract('papercontract', 'org.papernet.comm...'); Below, these lines of code submits a transaction to the network using the issue transaction defined within the smart contract. MagnetoCorp, 00001 are the values to be used by the issue transaction to create a new commercial paper // issue commercial paper const issueResponse = await contract.submitTransaction('issue','MagnetoCorp', '00001', '2020-05-31', '2020-11-30','5000000'); This statement, below, processes the response from the issue transaction. The response needs to be deserialized from a buffer into paper, a CommercialPaper object which can be interpreted correctly by the application // process response let paper = CommercialPaper.fromBuffer(issueResponse); 4. Since we know our issue.js file is looking at the ../gateway/networkConnection.yaml , we need to modify this file to represent our connection profile. We can do this by opening the networkConnection.yaml file in VSCode and then modifying the ports of our Orderer (line 91), Peer (line 105) and CA (117). You can find these ports by doing the following command from your terminal application. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/application$ docker ps -a Once you have modified the file, please save it (control + s) . 5. Enter the following command below to install the needed packages from the package.json file. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/application$ npm install . . # A bunch of output, with some of the output repeating . node-pre-gyp WARN Using request for node-pre-gyp https download [grpc] Success: \"/home/tecadmin/Desktop/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/application/node_modules/grpc/src/node/extension_binary/node-v57-darwin-x64-unknown/grpc_node.node\" is installed via remote npm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json. You should commit this file. npm WARN nodejs@1.0.0 No description npm WARN nodejs@1.0.0 No repository field. added 318 packages in 36.994s 6. Since we are in our command line, let's issue the following command that will create Isabella. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/application$ node addToWallet.js done 7. We will know it worked if we can execute the following command below successfully.

Below is a break down of the keys and certificate used in this example a private key c75bd6911a...-priv used to sign transactions on Isabella's behalf, but not distributed outside of her immediate control a public key c75bd6911a...-pub which is cryptographically linked to Isabella's private key. This is wholly contained within Isabella's X.509 certificate a certificate User1@org.example.com which contains Isabella's public key and other X.509 attributes added by the Certificate Authority at certificate creation. This certificate is distributed to the network so that different actors at different times can cryptographically verify information signed by Isabella's private key 8. Now that we have Isabella from MagnetoCorp, let's pass through the issue transaction from our terminal. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/application$ node issue.js Connect to Fabric gateway. Use network channel: mychannel. Use org.papernet.commercialpaper smart contract.

MagnetoCorp commercial paper : 00001 successfully issued for value 5000000 Transaction complete. Disconnect from Fabric gateway. Issue program complete. This successfully committed a transaction to the ledger. See how it outputted a transaction hash for us. As you can see in the image below, we are using the certificate belonging to Isabella to submit our paper issue transaction. Once we verify that Isabella can submit a transaction (via her certificate), the gateway allows the application to focus on transaction generation, submission and response. It coordinates the transaction proposal, ordering and notification processing between the different network components. 9. Since we have created an identity for MagnetoCorp, let's also create Balaji from DigiBank. To do so, we will need a third command line tab. We can add another command line tab by clicking on File - New Tab . This will create a new tab in the terminal from the exact folder directory we were in from our second command line tab. This third tab will act as DigiBank. 10. We now need to switch to a new directory, specifically the application folder of DigiBank. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/application$ cd ../../digibank/application/ tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/digibank/application$ 11. Navigate to the the application folder of DigiBank in the editior perspective in VSCode fabric-samples - commercial paper - organization - digibank - application You should see 5 files here: .eslintrc.js, addtowallet.js, buy.js, redeem.js and package.json 12. Go ahead and click on buy.js and scroll through the file. You will notice on line 40 that it is looking at the ../gateway/networkConnection.yaml file. We need to modify the networkConnection.yaml file to represent our network - very similar to step 4 of this section. 13. We need to modify the ports of our Orderer (line 91), Peer (line 105) and CA (117). We can find these ports by doing the following command from our terminal. If you are confused as to where to modify your port numbers, look at the picture on step 4 to get a sense as to where we are grabbing our ports from. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/digibank/application$ docker ps -a Once we have modified the file, please save it (control + s). NOTE: If you don't do this step, the rest of the lab will not work. 14. Back in our terminal and using our DigiBank tab, we can run the next command to install some required packages. NOTE: You will have to scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/digibank/application$ npm install . . . node-pre-gyp WARN Using request for node-pre-gyp https download [grpc] Success: \"/home/tecadmin/Desktop/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/digibank/application/node_modules/grpc/src/node/extension_binary/node-v57-darwin-x64-unknown/grpc_node.node\" is installed via remote npm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json. You should commit this file. npm WARN nodejs@1.0.0 No description npm WARN nodejs@1.0.0 No repository field. added 318 packages in 27.138s 15. Now, let's add an Balaji from DigiBank . NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/digibank/application$ node addToWallet.js done 16. We can confirm that we actually created an identity by viewing its public/private key below.

We are upgrading our smart contract because we can add in a query to get the status of our paper. Based on the picture below, we now have 2 participants in this network. Obviously, this is MagnetoCorp (Isabella) and DigiBank (Balaji). Both participants are allowed to interact with the commercial paper blockchain network through their application. Section 5: Upgrade Smart Contract 1. From our Explorer perspective, navigate to the contract/lib folder of DigiBank fabric-samples - commercial-paper - organization - digibank - contract - lib 2. Within the papercontract.js file, scroll down to line number 54 and enter the following lines of code below /** * Get commercial paper * @param {Context} ctx the transaction context * @param {String} issuer commercial paper issuer * @param {Integer} paperNumber paper number for this issuer */ async getPaper(ctx, issuer, paperNumber) { try { console.log(\"getPaper for: \" + issuer + \" \" + paperNumber); let paperKey = CommercialPaper.makeKey([issuer, paperNumber]); let paper = await ctx.paperList.getPaper(paperKey); return paper.toBuffer(); } catch(e) { throw new Error('Paper does not exist' + issuer + paperNumber); } } 3. From the terminal in our digibank tab , add a file below that will execute a query that we just added to our smart contract. NOTE: there are multiple steps in this command and you will have to scroll over to see the entire series of commands below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/digibank/application$ touch getPaper.js tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/digibank/application$ vi getPaper.js --- type the letter \"i\" to go into insert mode and paste in the following lines of code below --- /* SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 */ /* * This application has 6 basic steps: * 1.

Then type in \":wq\" and then press enter to save the file Who knew you would learn VSCode and vi ! Send your hate mail to :) 4. We now have a new file ( getPaper.js ) and then it is in our papercontract.js smart contract. This doesn't mean we can execute a getPaper query because, if you remember, we have to install and instantiate this update onto our peer. Then - and only then - can we actually submit the getPaper query. The next few steps will walk us through how to do that. It would be helpful to understand what we just added to our soon-to-be-updated smart contract. The getPaper query is being submitted by Balaji from DigiBank and it allows him to get the current status of the paper within the network. For example, it prints out the paper's identification number, paper's cost, paper's state (trading, redeemed, issued), paper's issue date and a few other key details. Here is a further breakdown of the query Below, this statement brings two key Hyperledger Fabric SDK classes into scope -- Wallet and Gateway. Because Balaji\u2019s X.509 certificate is in the local file system, the application uses FileSystemWallet // Bring key classes into scope, most importantly Fabric SDK network class const { FileSystemWallet, Gateway } = require('fabric-network'); Below, this statement identifies that the application will use Balaji's wallet when it connects to the blockchain network channel. The application will select a particular identity within Balaji's wallet. (The wallet must have been loaded with Balaji's X.509 certificate -- that's what addToWallet.js does.) // A wallet stores a collection of identities for use const wallet = new FileSystemWallet('../identity/user/balaji/wallet'); Below, this line of code connects to the network using the gateway identified by connectionProfile, using the identity referred to in connectionOptions. See how ../gateway/networkConnection.yaml and Admin@org1.example.com are used for these values respectively // Connect to gateway using application specified parameters await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, connectionOptions); Below, this connects the application to the network channel mychannel, where the papercontract was previously instantiated. If you had a different channel name, you would have to modify this line of code // Access commercial paper network const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel'); Below, this statement gives the application addressability to smart contract defined by the namespace org.papernet.commercialpaper within papercontract. Once an application has issued getContract, it can submit any transaction/query implemented within it // Get addressability to commercial paper contract const contract = await network.getContract('papercontract','org.papernet.commercialpaper'); This series of log output is what the query prints out for us. Based on the defined variables in the papercontract.js we are able to query for pretty specific bits of data to get an overview of our paper. You can look above and see how we are grabbing our paperState console.log(` +--------- Paper Retrieved ---------+ `); console.log(` | Paper number: \"${paper.paperNumber}\"`); console.log(` | Paper is owned by: \"${paper.owner}\"`); console.log(` | Paper is currently: \"${paperState}\"`); console.log(` | Paper face value: \"${paper.faceValue}\"`); console.log(` | Paper is issued by: \"${paper.issuer}\"`); console.log(` | Paper issue on: \"${paper.issueDateTime}\"`); console.log(` | Paper matures on: \"${paper.maturityDateTime}\"`); console.log(` +-----------------------------------+ `); console.log('Transaction complete.'); Below, this part of the code looks at the let paper = CommercialPaper.fromBuffer(getPaperResponse); message and then defines what the current status of the paper is. There for 4 options, UNKNOWN, ISSUED, TRADING, and REDEEMED let paper = CommercialPaper.fromBuffer(getPaperResponse); let paperState = \"Unknown\"; if (paper.isIssued()) { paperState = \"ISSUED\"; } else if (paper.isTrading()) { paperState = \"TRADING\"; } else if (paper.isRedeemed()) { paperState = \"REDEEMED\"; } Below, this chunk of code simply leaves the gateway it is connected to, thus ending the query. No matter if our query was successful or if there was an error, we'll be disconnected from the gateway // Disconnect from the gateway console.log('Disconnect from Fabric gateway.') gateway.disconnect(); 5. In order to upgrade our smart contract, we need to add a fabric gateway to our IBM Blockchain extension. To do that, switch back to the IBM Blockchain extension within VSCode and click on the gear icon in the bottom left. Then, click on Command Palette 6 To add a Fabric Gateway, type this, below, in the search bar of our list of commands to execute IBM Blockchain Platform: Add Gateway Fabric gateways are ways for us to connect to a blockchain network from a perspective. In this case, we are acting as Balaji from DigiBank in this commercial paper network. If there were more actors, you could envision more gateways being incorportated here 7. For the name of the gateway, enter papercontract 8. When it asks for a file path to a connection profile , select Browse 9. Then navigate to the networkConnection.yaml file within Digibank to grab the connection profile 10. It will then ask us if we would like to use an existing wallet or create a new wallet. We want to choose Use an existing wallet on my file system 11. When it asks for a file path to a wallet directory , select Browse 12. Then, we will navigate to our user's, Balaji , wallet. Click on Select once you have clicked and highlighted on wallet 13. We will then see a new Fabric Gateway within the IBM Blockchain extension as well as successful messages from the output 14. We can then click on Admin@org1.example.com and then it will show all of our channels. Furthermore, it will show all the smart contracts available on the channel. You'll see we have mycontract@0.0.1 and papercontract@0 . Even further, we can see all the available transactions/queries based on the smart contract. All of these are available if we untoggle the channels and smart contracts. Even though we have added the new fabric gateway, we still haven't updated our smart contract to include the getPaper query. We will do that in the next series of commands. 15. Switch back to the Explorer perspective and toggle the fabric-samples to hide all of the folders and files. Then click on File and select Add Folder to Workplace to add a new folder to the workspace 16. Once it gives us a pop-up of the folder directory, navigate to the contract folder of Digibank . Click on or highlight the contract folder fabric-samples - commercial-paper - organization - digibank - contract 17. Here we will name the smart contract papercontract and give it version 0.0.2 . First, untoggle the contract folder and click on the package.json file to open it. Within that file, change lines 2 and 3 to look like this below \"name\": \"papercontract\", \"version\": \"0.0.2\", 18. Switch back to the IBM Blockchain extension. From there click on the gear in the bottom left and select Command Palette . When the search bar of available commands appears, type in the following below IBM Blockchain Platform: Package a Smart Contract Project 22. When it asks for a workplace folder to package choose contract . Then it will pull in the folder and name it papercontract@0.0.2 based on our modifications to the package.json file 23. Now that we have our packaged smart contract, let's upgrade our current smart contract. To do so, within the Local Fabric Ops pane, untoggle the Channels and right click on mychannel . Then select Upgrade Smart Contract 24. It will then ask which current smart contract we want to upgrade. We want to select papercontract@0 to upgrade. Then it will ask which smart contract version to preform an upgrade with , we want to select papercontract@0.0.2 . Since we have to install our upgraded contract on a peer, select peer0.org1.example.com to install the smart contract on. When it asks for any arguments, do not enter anything here, but rather - simply - press enter to execute our upgrade. You will know this was successful if we click on Admin@org1.example.com under the papercontract gateway. Further, untoggle the papercontract@0.0.2 smart contract to see all the available transactions and queries. Now, we have successfully upgraded our smart contract to include the getPaper query. Now, lets have some fun and make some transactions and queries! Section 6: Submit Transactions 1. If you remember, we already did an issue transaction back before upgrading our smart contract. Since we have added the getPaper query to our smart contract, let's do that from the digibank perspective using getPaper.js . As you already know, the getPaper query will get the current status of the paper on top of other bits of information, like price. 2. From the digibank perspective in your terminal (your 3rd terminal) enter this command.

Disconnect from Fabric gateway. getPaper program complete. 7. We have successfully run a few transactions and queries with 1 paper and all from our terminal. Now, let's make a 2nd paper and mix up the method of how we do the transactions and queries. To do this, go back to VSCode and into the Explorer perspective. From there, navigate to the issue.js file within MagnetoCorp fabric-samples - commercial-paper - organization - magnetocorp - application - issue.js 8. On what should be line 68 , change the issue transaction code to what is below. NOTE: scroll over to see the line of code change below Take this.. const issueResponse = await contract.submitTransaction('issue', 'MagnetoCorp', '00001', '2020-05-31', '2020-11-30', '5000000'); ..and change to const issueResponse = await contract.submitTransaction('issue', 'MagnetoCorp', '00002', '2019-06-31', '2019-12-30', '6000000'); That line of code is creating a new paper. Go ahead and save this file (control + s) . 9. Equally, navigate to the getPaper.js file within digibank and change the key below to look for a paper with an id of 00002 on line 68 fabric-samples - commercial-paper - organization - digibank - application - getPaper.js --- Take this.. const getPaperResponse = await contract.evaluateTransaction('getPaper', 'MagnetoCorp', '00001'); .. and change to const getPaperResponse = await contract.evaluateTransaction('getPaper', 'MagnetoCorp', '00002'); That line of code is changing the getPaper.js file to look for the paper with an ID of 00002 . Go ahead and save this file (control + s) . 10. Now that we have modified our code, let's go ahead and issue a new paper from our terminal. To do this, we have to be in our MagnetoCorp perspective (our 2nd terminal tab). Within that command line, enter this. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/application$ node issue.js Connect to Fabric gateway.

Disconnect from Fabric gateway. getPaper program complete. 12. That's enough command line for right now, let's jump to VSCode and buy our new paper there. Within the IBM Blockchain extension, go to the Fabric Gateway and click on the papercontect gateway. From there, click on Admin@org1.example.com and untoggle to the transactions and query. Then, right click on the buy transaction and select Submit Transaction When it asks for some arguments to pass in with the buy transaction, enter this below MagnetoCorp,00002,MagnetoCorp,DigiBank,5900000,2019-07-31 13. We will see that transaction was successful from the output it generated in VSCode. We can confirm that by doing a getPaper.js query again in our terminal (3rd terminal tab).

Disconnect from Fabric gateway. getPaper program complete. 14. We are going to repeat the previous 2 steps, but this time we are going to do a redeem transaction from the IBM Blockchain extension. To do this, go to the Fabric Gateway pane and click on the papercontract gateway. From there, click on Admin@org1.example.com and untoggle to the transactions and query. Then, right click on redeem and select Submit Transaction When it asks for some arguments to pass through, enter this below : MagnetoCorp,00002,DigiBank,2019-12-30 15.

If you do not want to make more papers, please continue to last section, which will simply clean up the lab environment. Section 7: Lab Cleanup 1. To clean up the lab environment, please enter this in your terminal below docker stop $(docker ps -q) # to stop all of your running docker containers docker rm $(docker ps -aq) # to remove all of your docker containers docker rmi -f $(docker images -q) # to remove all of your docker images 2. Finally, go back to your Explorer perspective and right click on all of your folders and select Remove Folder from Workplace . This will get rid of all of your folders. END OF LAB!","title":"Part 2"},{"location":"vscode-part2/#part-2-commercial-paper-tutorial","text":"","title":"Part 2: Commercial Paper Tutorial"},{"location":"vscode-part2/#section-1-overview","text":"This tutorial is of a commercial paper (known as PaperNet ) trading network. Commercial paper itself is a type of unsecured lending in the form of a \"promissory note\". The papers are normally issued by large corporations to raise funds to meet short-term financial obligations at a fixed rate of interest. Once issued at a fixed price, for a fixed term, another company or bank will purchase them at a discount to the face value and when the term is up, they will be redeemed for their face value. As an example, if a paper was issued at a face value of 10M USD for a 6-month term at 2% interest then it could be bought for 9.8M USD (10M -- 2%) by another company or bank who are happy to bear the risk that the issuer will not default. Once the term is up, then the paper could be redeemed or sold back to the issuer for their full face value of 10M USD. Between buying and redemption, the paper can be bought or sold between different parties on a commercial paper market. These three key steps of issue, buy and redeem are the main transactions in a simplified commercial paper marketplace, which we will mirror in our lab. We will see a commercial paper issued by a company called MagnetoCorp and once issued on the commercial paper blockchain network, another company called DigiBank will first buy the paper and then redeem it. You'll act as a developer, end user, and administrator, each in different organizations, performing the following steps designed to help you understand what it's like to collaborate as two different organizations working independently, but according to mutually agreed rules in a Hyperledger Fabric network. Below is an image of our PaperNet network. For our lab, we will create Isabella who is with MagnetoCorp. Additionally, we will create Balaji who is with DigiBank. Isabella will issue a paper for the network. The paper will have an ID number, when it was issued, the maturity date, and the face value ($). Balaji, from DigiBank, will then buy the paper and then eventually redeem it. Below is the full breakdown of Part 2 of this lab: Setting the Stage: Based off of Part 1, we have started a blockchain network, created a smart contract, created and run tests and then submitted transactions. For Part 2, we need to create a couple more docker containers that will set us up for success for the rest of the lab. One of these containers will just monitor the docker network we are operating in. If you have no idea what a docker network is, I will explain later on. The other continer is fabric-tools , but it is named cliMagnetoCorp which will be how we install and instantiate the first time. Install and Instantiate Smart Contract: Now that we have those new docker containers up and running, we will enter our cliMagnetoCorp container and install and instantiate our smart contract. Since we are connected to the same running local Hyperledger Fabric network, we will see the smart contract show up in VSCode. Issue Identities: In this section, we will issue two identites. One is an end-user named Isabella with MagnetoCorp . She will invoke a transaction that will issue a paper. Then we will issue an identity for DigiBank named Balaji . Balaji will act as the adminstrator for Digibank and will buy and redeem the paper that Isabella issued. Balaji is important in this lab, as we will add a Fabric Gateway connection to connect to his perspective of the network. Upgrade Smart Contract: This section is the longest of the entire lab, but it really exemplifies the power of VSCode and the IBM Blockchain Platform extension. We will update our smart contract code to include one more transaction called getPaper . This transaction will allow us to see the current status of the paper, like who knows it, what is its status and how much is it worth. In addition to modifiying the code, we will update our smart contract so that the network is aware of the new smart contract. Submit Transactions: Now that we have added a transaction to our smart contract, we will then submit various transactions from many different places and perspectives. For example, we will issue a transaction from the command line interface as well as the VSCode user interface. We will also issue another paper from Isabella's perspective and then invoke a series of transactions to buy and redeem the paper from Balaji. Lab Cleanup: This is the most bittersweet part of the entire lab. It means the lab is over and we have to clean up. If you have kids (I don't), I'd imagine their faces are sad and full of despair when you (the guardian) tell them to clean up their mess. I'd also like to imagine your face is making a similar expression right now. It's okay, more fun is going to be had soon - very soon!","title":"Section 1: Overview"},{"location":"vscode-part2/#section-2-setting-the-stage","text":"NOTE: There are two terminals we can operate in - the actual terminal application and the terminal found in VSCode. Unless I explicitly say, only use the terminal application - meaning do not use the terminal in VSCode. On the chance that we will use the terminal in VSCode, I will specify that. 1.

We need to know the Docker network that we are currently in so that we can modify some scripts, that will then create more Docker containers for us to use. Enter the command below to see all of our Docker networks tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract$ docker network list NETWORK ID NAME DRIVER SCOPE ad2e1a3e2fc2 bridge bridge local 35837170ae5b fabricvscodelocalfabric_basic bridge local c5e0411b0d34 host host local 42ffa501f2f9 none null local 3. The network we are in is called fabricvscodelocalfabric_basic and we can verify that by doing the following command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract$ docker network inspect fabricvscodelocalfabric_basic That command will show you all the containers running in this network. In a nutshell, docker networks are natural ways to isolate containers from other containers or other networks. Having containers within a network allows them to immediately communicate with other containers in the network. 4. Within VSCode, go to the Editor perspective and click on File and select Add Folder to Workplace.. - This will allow us to work from an Untitled Workplace , but have the fabric-samples folder in there. 5. Within VSCode, navigate to the folder below within MagnetoCorp fabric-samples - commercial paper - organizations - magenetocorp - configuration - cli You should see two files in there. One named docker-compose-yml and another named monitordocker.sh 6. Within the docker-compose.yml file, replace the net_basic with fabricvscodelocalfabric_basic on line 11 and save your file by pressing control + s 7. Now within the monitordocker.sh file, replace basicnetwork_basic with fabricvscodelocalfabric_basic on line 9 and again save by pressing control + s 8. Now from the terminal navigate to the cli directory within MagnetoCorp. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract$ cd fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli/ tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli/$ ls -l total 16 -rw-r--r-- 1 tecadmin tecadmin 1168 Feb 22 12:41 docker-compose.yml -rwxr-xr-x 1 tecadmin tecadmin 751 Feb 22 12:44 monitordocker.sh 9. Now that we have updated these files to represent the correct Docker network, go ahead run the monitordocker file with the name of our Docker network. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli/$ ./monitordocker.sh fabricvscodelocalfabric_basic This command will pull down another container that just monitors all of the docker log output from the fabricvscodelocalfabric_basic network. I'm going off a hunch, but I think that's why the file is called monitordocker.sh . We will see more messages coming very soon. 10. Since this terminal is occupied with log messages, let's open another terminal tab. We can open a new tab by clicking on File and then selecting New Tab 11. When you opened a new tab, you should have been taken to the same file path that you were in on the previous tab. Now that we have a command line ready, go ahead and enter the command below that will create a cliMagnetoCorp container for our docker network to use.

Creating cliMagnetoCorp ... done When we first install the smart contract, we will go through the cliMagnetoCorp container, which is our Administrator Console. This will allow use to use Fabric peer commands. Conveniently, the cliMagnetoCorp container is the hyperledger/fabric-tools image. 12. We can also do a docker ps -a command to see all of our docker containers. We should see two new containers - cliMagnetoCorp and logspout 13. Equally, we could do docker network inspect fabricvscodelocalfabric_basic to see all of our containers together in one network - and no, not in a blockchain network. They are, however, the components that make up our local blockchain network :)","title":"Section 2: Setting the Stage"},{"location":"vscode-part2/#section-3-install-and-instantiate-smart-contract","text":"Before we actually install the commercial paper smart contract, let's actually open the file to see what the smart contract is trying to do. 1. From your explorer perspective, navigate from the fabric-samples folder to the contract folder of MagnetoCorp fabric-samples - commercial-paper - organization - magnetocorp - contract Within the lib folder, you'll see 3 javascript (.js) files in there. Click on the papercontract.js file, which will open it that file within VSCode Let's dissect our papercontract.js file as it is our smart contract. We will only go over the issue transaction, but the other transactions follow pretty closely to this one Below, these 2 lines of code brings into scope two key Hyperledger Fabric classes that will be used extensively by the smart contract -- Contract and Context // Fabric smart contract classes const { Contract, Context } = require('fabric-contract-api'); Below, we define the smart contract class CommercialPaperContract based on the built-in Fabric Contract class. The methods which implement the key transactions to issue, buy and redeem commercial paper are defined within this class /** * Define commercial paper smart contract by extending Fabric Contract class * */ class CommercialPaperContract extends Contract { Below, this method defines the commercial paper issue transaction for commercial paper blockchain network. The parameters that are passed to this method will be used to create the new commercial paper. Locate and examine the buy and redeem transactions within the smart contract /** * Issue commercial paper * * @param {Context} ctx the transaction context * @param {String} issuer commercial paper issuer * @param {Integer} paperNumber paper number for this issuer * @param {String} issueDateTime paper issue date * @param {String} maturityDateTime paper maturity date * @param {Integer} faceValue face value of paper */ async issue(ctx, issuer, paperNumber, issueDateTime, maturityDateTime, faceValue) { Within the issue transaction, this statement creates a new commercial paper in memory using the CommercialPaper class with the supplied transaction inputs. Examine the buy and redeem transactions to see how they similarly use this class below // create an instance of the paper let paper = CommercialPaper.createInstance(issuer, paperNumber, issueDateTime, maturityDateTime, faceValue); Below, this statement adds the new commercial paper to the ledger using ctx.paperList, an instance of a PaperList class that was created when the smart contract context CommercialPaperContext was initialized. Again, examine the buy and redeem methods to see how they use this class // Add the paper to the list of all similar commercial papers in the ledger world state await ctx.paperList.addPaper(paper); Below you will find that this statement returns a binary buffer as response from the issue transaction for processing by the caller of the smart contract // Must return a serialized paper to caller of smart contract return paper.toBuffer(); 2. Now that we have an understanding of the smart contract, let's actually install it on our peer through our terminal. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli/$ docker exec cliMagnetoCorp peer chaincode install -n papercontract -v 0 -p /opt/gopath/src/github.com/contract -l node 2019-02-22 17:48:23.721 UTC [chaincodeCmd] checkChaincodeCmdParams - INFO 001 Using default escc 2019-02-22 17:48:23.721 UTC [chaincodeCmd] checkChaincodeCmdParams - INFO 002 Using default vscc 2019-02-22 17:48:23.862 UTC [chaincodeCmd] install - INFO 003 Installed remotely response: status:200 payload:\"OK\" A message saying 200 is a great sign to see. If you notice, we are not in the contract folder of our command line interface. Instead, we are entering the cliMagnetoCorp docker container with docker exec cliMagnetoCorp and navigating to the /opt/gopath/src/github.com/contract file path within our container to grab the files we need to install the smart contract. The -n papercontract flag names our smart contract papercontract . The -v 0 gives our smart contract a version of 0. Finally, the -l node tells us that the language of our smart contract is nodejs. The picture below goes into detail, visually, as to how we are actually installing a copy of the commercial paper smart contract on our peer. 3. Since our network is connected to our VSCode instance, you can refresh the Local Fabric Ops panel in VSCode under the IBM Blockchain extension. The refresh button is revealed when you hover your mouse over the Local Fabric Ops panel 4. Since we have installed the smart contract, we should actually make it active by instantiating it.

Similar to the installation of the smart contract, the instantiation goes into the cliMagnetoCorp container. After successfully instantiating the smart contract, there will be a commercial paper smart contract docker image and container. 5. You will know our instantiate command worked when we simply get our command prompt back. You can really verify it worked by going back to the VSCode and refreshing the Local Fabric Ops panel and you should see it under the instantiate section.","title":"Section 3: Install and Instantiate Smart Contract"},{"location":"vscode-part2/#section-4-issue-identities","text":"Now that we have a ready-to-use smart contract, let's issue some identities so that those identities can invoke and query transactions. 1. You should be within the cli folder of the MagnetoCorp folder. You can confirm this by issuing the command below.

From the Explorer perspective within VSCode, navigate to the same folder. That is, the application folder within MagnetoCorp . You should see 4 files in there: .eslintrc.js, addToWallet.js, issue.js , and package.json 3. Click on issue.js , which will open the file within VSCode. Let's discuss what the file is trying to do. Below we bring in two key Hyperledger Fabric SDK classes into scope -- Wallet and Gateway . Because Isabella's X.509 certificate is in the local file system, the application uses FileSystemWallet // Bring key classes into scope, most importantly Fabric SDK network class const { FileSystemWallet, Gateway } = require('fabric-network'); Below, this statement identifies that the application will use Isabella's wallet when it connects to the blockchain network channel. The application will select a particular identity within Isabella's wallet. (The wallet must have been loaded with Isabella's X.509 certificate -- that's what addToWallet.js does.) // A wallet stores a collection of identities for use const wallet = new FileSystemWallet('../identity/user/isabella/wallet'); This line of code, below, connects to the network using the gateway identified by connectionProfile , using the identity referred to in ConnectionOptions . See how ../gateway/networkConnection.yaml and User1@org1.example.com are used for these values respectively // Connect to gateway using application specified parameters await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, connectionOptions); Below in the couple lines of code, connects the application to the network channel mychannel , where the papercontract was previously instantiated. If you had a different channel name, you would have to modify this line of code // Access commercial paper network const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel'); Below, this statement gives the application addressability to the smart contract defined by the namespace org.papernet.commercialpaper within papercontract. Once an application has issued getContract, it can submit any transaction implemented within it // Get addressability to commercial paper contract const contract = await network.getContract('papercontract', 'org.papernet.comm...'); Below, these lines of code submits a transaction to the network using the issue transaction defined within the smart contract. MagnetoCorp, 00001 are the values to be used by the issue transaction to create a new commercial paper // issue commercial paper const issueResponse = await contract.submitTransaction('issue','MagnetoCorp', '00001', '2020-05-31', '2020-11-30','5000000'); This statement, below, processes the response from the issue transaction. The response needs to be deserialized from a buffer into paper, a CommercialPaper object which can be interpreted correctly by the application // process response let paper = CommercialPaper.fromBuffer(issueResponse); 4. Since we know our issue.js file is looking at the ../gateway/networkConnection.yaml , we need to modify this file to represent our connection profile. We can do this by opening the networkConnection.yaml file in VSCode and then modifying the ports of our Orderer (line 91), Peer (line 105) and CA (117). You can find these ports by doing the following command from your terminal application.

Below is a break down of the keys and certificate used in this example a private key c75bd6911a...-priv used to sign transactions on Isabella's behalf, but not distributed outside of her immediate control a public key c75bd6911a...-pub which is cryptographically linked to Isabella's private key. This is wholly contained within Isabella's X.509 certificate a certificate User1@org.example.com which contains Isabella's public key and other X.509 attributes added by the Certificate Authority at certificate creation. This certificate is distributed to the network so that different actors at different times can cryptographically verify information signed by Isabella's private key 8. Now that we have Isabella from MagnetoCorp, let's pass through the issue transaction from our terminal. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/application$ node issue.js Connect to Fabric gateway.

MagnetoCorp commercial paper : 00001 successfully issued for value 5000000 Transaction complete. Disconnect from Fabric gateway. Issue program complete. This successfully committed a transaction to the ledger. See how it outputted a transaction hash for us. As you can see in the image below, we are using the certificate belonging to Isabella to submit our paper issue transaction. Once we verify that Isabella can submit a transaction (via her certificate), the gateway allows the application to focus on transaction generation, submission and response. It coordinates the transaction proposal, ordering and notification processing between the different network components. 9. Since we have created an identity for MagnetoCorp, let's also create Balaji from DigiBank. To do so, we will need a third command line tab. We can add another command line tab by clicking on File - New Tab . This will create a new tab in the terminal from the exact folder directory we were in from our second command line tab. This third tab will act as DigiBank. 10. We now need to switch to a new directory, specifically the application folder of DigiBank.

Navigate to the the application folder of DigiBank in the editior perspective in VSCode fabric-samples - commercial paper - organization - digibank - application You should see 5 files here: .eslintrc.js, addtowallet.js, buy.js, redeem.js and package.json 12. Go ahead and click on buy.js and scroll through the file. You will notice on line 40 that it is looking at the ../gateway/networkConnection.yaml file. We need to modify the networkConnection.yaml file to represent our network - very similar to step 4 of this section. 13. We need to modify the ports of our Orderer (line 91), Peer (line 105) and CA (117). We can find these ports by doing the following command from our terminal. If you are confused as to where to modify your port numbers, look at the picture on step 4 to get a sense as to where we are grabbing our ports from. NOTE: scroll over to see the entire command below tecadmin@ubuntubase:~/Desktop/mycontract/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/digibank/application$ docker ps -a Once we have modified the file, please save it (control + s).

We are upgrading our smart contract because we can add in a query to get the status of our paper. Based on the picture below, we now have 2 participants in this network. Obviously, this is MagnetoCorp (Isabella) and DigiBank (Balaji). Both participants are allowed to interact with the commercial paper blockchain network through their application.","title":"Section 4: Issue Identities"},{"location":"vscode-part2/#section-5-upgrade-smart-contract","text":"1.

Then type in \":wq\" and then press enter to save the file Who knew you would learn VSCode and vi ! Send your hate mail to :) 4. We now have a new file ( getPaper.js ) and then it is in our papercontract.js smart contract. This doesn't mean we can execute a getPaper query because, if you remember, we have to install and instantiate this update onto our peer. Then - and only then - can we actually submit the getPaper query. The next few steps will walk us through how to do that. It would be helpful to understand what we just added to our soon-to-be-updated smart contract. The getPaper query is being submitted by Balaji from DigiBank and it allows him to get the current status of the paper within the network. For example, it prints out the paper's identification number, paper's cost, paper's state (trading, redeemed, issued), paper's issue date and a few other key details. Here is a further breakdown of the query Below, this statement brings two key Hyperledger Fabric SDK classes into scope -- Wallet and Gateway. Because Balaji\u2019s X.509 certificate is in the local file system, the application uses FileSystemWallet // Bring key classes into scope, most importantly Fabric SDK network class const { FileSystemWallet, Gateway } = require('fabric-network'); Below, this statement identifies that the application will use Balaji's wallet when it connects to the blockchain network channel. The application will select a particular identity within Balaji's wallet. (The wallet must have been loaded with Balaji's X.509 certificate -- that's what addToWallet.js does.) // A wallet stores a collection of identities for use const wallet = new FileSystemWallet('../identity/user/balaji/wallet'); Below, this line of code connects to the network using the gateway identified by connectionProfile, using the identity referred to in connectionOptions. See how ../gateway/networkConnection.yaml and Admin@org1.example.com are used for these values respectively // Connect to gateway using application specified parameters await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, connectionOptions); Below, this connects the application to the network channel mychannel, where the papercontract was previously instantiated. If you had a different channel name, you would have to modify this line of code // Access commercial paper network const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel'); Below, this statement gives the application addressability to smart contract defined by the namespace org.papernet.commercialpaper within papercontract. Once an application has issued getContract, it can submit any transaction/query implemented within it // Get addressability to commercial paper contract const contract = await network.getContract('papercontract','org.papernet.commercialpaper'); This series of log output is what the query prints out for us. Based on the defined variables in the papercontract.js we are able to query for pretty specific bits of data to get an overview of our paper. You can look above and see how we are grabbing our paperState console.log(` +--------- Paper Retrieved ---------+ `); console.log(` | Paper number: \"${paper.paperNumber}\"`); console.log(` | Paper is owned by: \"${paper.owner}\"`); console.log(` | Paper is currently: \"${paperState}\"`); console.log(` | Paper face value: \"${paper.faceValue}\"`); console.log(` | Paper is issued by: \"${paper.issuer}\"`); console.log(` | Paper issue on: \"${paper.issueDateTime}\"`); console.log(` | Paper matures on: \"${paper.maturityDateTime}\"`); console.log(` +-----------------------------------+ `); console.log('Transaction complete.'); Below, this part of the code looks at the let paper = CommercialPaper.fromBuffer(getPaperResponse); message and then defines what the current status of the paper is. There for 4 options, UNKNOWN, ISSUED, TRADING, and REDEEMED let paper = CommercialPaper.fromBuffer(getPaperResponse); let paperState = \"Unknown\"; if (paper.isIssued()) { paperState = \"ISSUED\"; } else if (paper.isTrading()) { paperState = \"TRADING\"; } else if (paper.isRedeemed()) { paperState = \"REDEEMED\"; } Below, this chunk of code simply leaves the gateway it is connected to, thus ending the query. No matter if our query was successful or if there was an error, we'll be disconnected from the gateway // Disconnect from the gateway console.log('Disconnect from Fabric gateway.') gateway.disconnect(); 5. In order to upgrade our smart contract, we need to add a fabric gateway to our IBM Blockchain extension. To do that, switch back to the IBM Blockchain extension within VSCode and click on the gear icon in the bottom left. Then, click on Command Palette 6 To add a Fabric Gateway, type this, below, in the search bar of our list of commands to execute IBM Blockchain Platform: Add Gateway Fabric gateways are ways for us to connect to a blockchain network from a perspective. In this case, we are acting as Balaji from DigiBank in this commercial paper network. If there were more actors, you could envision more gateways being incorportated here 7. For the name of the gateway, enter papercontract 8. When it asks for a file path to a connection profile , select Browse 9. Then navigate to the networkConnection.yaml file within Digibank to grab the connection profile 10. It will then ask us if we would like to use an existing wallet or create a new wallet. We want to choose Use an existing wallet on my file system 11. When it asks for a file path to a wallet directory , select Browse 12. Then, we will navigate to our user's, Balaji , wallet. Click on Select once you have clicked and highlighted on wallet 13. We will then see a new Fabric Gateway within the IBM Blockchain extension as well as successful messages from the output 14. We can then click on Admin@org1.example.com and then it will show all of our channels. Furthermore, it will show all the smart contracts available on the channel. You'll see we have mycontract@0.0.1 and papercontract@0 . Even further, we can see all the available transactions/queries based on the smart contract. All of these are available if we untoggle the channels and smart contracts. Even though we have added the new fabric gateway, we still haven't updated our smart contract to include the getPaper query. We will do that in the next series of commands. 15. Switch back to the Explorer perspective and toggle the fabric-samples to hide all of the folders and files. Then click on File and select Add Folder to Workplace to add a new folder to the workspace 16. Once it gives us a pop-up of the folder directory, navigate to the contract folder of Digibank . Click on or highlight the contract folder fabric-samples - commercial-paper - organization - digibank - contract 17. Here we will name the smart contract papercontract and give it version 0.0.2 . First, untoggle the contract folder and click on the package.json file to open it. Within that file, change lines 2 and 3 to look like this below \"name\": \"papercontract\", \"version\": \"0.0.2\", 18. Switch back to the IBM Blockchain extension. From there click on the gear in the bottom left and select Command Palette . When the search bar of available commands appears, type in the following below IBM Blockchain Platform: Package a Smart Contract Project 22. When it asks for a workplace folder to package choose contract . Then it will pull in the folder and name it papercontract@0.0.2 based on our modifications to the package.json file 23. Now that we have our packaged smart contract, let's upgrade our current smart contract. To do so, within the Local Fabric Ops pane, untoggle the Channels and right click on mychannel . Then select Upgrade Smart Contract 24. It will then ask which current smart contract we want to upgrade. We want to select papercontract@0 to upgrade. Then it will ask which smart contract version to preform an upgrade with , we want to select papercontract@0.0.2 . Since we have to install our upgraded contract on a peer, select peer0.org1.example.com to install the smart contract on. When it asks for any arguments, do not enter anything here, but rather - simply - press enter to execute our upgrade. You will know this was successful if we click on Admin@org1.example.com under the papercontract gateway. Further, untoggle the papercontract@0.0.2 smart contract to see all the available transactions and queries. Now, we have successfully upgraded our smart contract to include the getPaper query. Now, lets have some fun and make some transactions and queries!","title":"Section 5: Upgrade Smart Contract"},{"location":"vscode-part2/#section-6-submit-transactions","text":"1.
